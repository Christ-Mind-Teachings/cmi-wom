title: A Prayer of Remembrance
---

<span markdown="1" class="dropcaps">F</span>ather-Mother God,<br/>
Source of our Being,<br/>
we are returned.

Joining together,<br/>
we celebrate the Love that,<br/>
together, we are.

Where there has been an unreal world,<br/>
we now give birth to a world atoned,<br/>
that it may perfectly reflect<br/>
what you have completed in us.

Because we are made,<br/>
even in this moment,<br/>
in your image,<br/>
our love is without ceasing,<br/>
forever, and ever, and ever!

*Amen*
