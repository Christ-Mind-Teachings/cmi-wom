and servantship<br/> are one.<br/> For where one is, the other is
found.</p>

And where the other is,<br/>
the one is also known.

Mastery is that state<br/>
in which not one thing of the world<br/>
*compels* you in any direction,<br/>
yet not one thing of the world is judged.<br/>
This must naturally follow<br/>
for the mind to which peace is returned.

To lack mastery<br/>
in any aspect of life<br/>
is to lack it in all.

Mastery<br/>
is the foundation from which<br/>
the servant enacts<br/>
the movement of Love<br/>
proceeding from the Father<br/>
through the Son,<br/>
serving the one goal of Atonement<br/>
by demonstrating its completion<br/>
*in you.*

This is given<br/>
as a clear sign unto you:<br/>
Mastery is completed when not one habit<br/>
learned of the world remains;<br/>
not one “love”<br/>
you have miscreated for yourself<br/>
is justified of you.

Look well, then,<br/>
at the whole of your life,<br/>
and behold with innocent honesty<br/>
the “loves” you would keep for yourself,<br/>
for what can you carry forth<br/>
from death to Life?<br/>
Even the body will be outshined.

And if you love the Father<br/>
above the world,<br/>
what would you leave untransformed<br/>
by the radiance of your union?

You can give<br/>
only what you possess,<br/>
and what you possess exists for you<br/>
only because you value it.

What treasure<br/>
will you lay at your brother’s feet?<br/>
For where your treasure is,<br/>
there shall your heart be also,<br/>
and your heart is all that *can* be given.

I have said before<br/>
that the world is but a *symbol*.<br/>
Choose wisely what *your* world<br/>
will symbolize for you,<br/>
for it is the symbols you choose<br/>
which your sister will see.<br/>
Thus is your heart revealed,<br/>
and you have “spoken” your judgment<br/>
of the Father.

She who knows me<br/>
walks with me,<br/>
and she who walks with me<br/>
makes straight her path,<br/>
and all things are given<br/>
to the praise of what God is:<br/>
Love.

Love embraces all things,<br/>
heals all things,<br/>
transforms all things,<br/>
celebrates all things,<br/>
and, above all,<br/>
mirrors what God is *in* all things.

Give no thought, then,<br/>
for tomorrow,<br/>
neither for the things you shall eat,<br/>
nor for the things you shall wear,<br/>
for the Father knows you have need<br/>
of these things,<br/>
and He will not leave you comfortless.

When I once asked you<br/>
to “take no thought”<br/>
you unwittingly failed to hear me,<br/>
deciding *you* can direct the choice<br/>
of what you would eat,<br/>
and what you would wear,<br/>
and thus cleverly cherish<br/>
the “loves” you would desire to keep.<br/>
To decide for yourself<br/>
is precisely to *take* thought.<br/>
That is,<br/>
because you failed<br/>
to let the Comforter choose for you,<br/>
right-mindedness was cast aside,<br/>
and the real world abandoned.

But she<br/>
who praises God in *all* things<br/>
keeps no decision for herself,<br/>
listening only to the Voice for God,<br/>
and the servant knows<br/>
the Voice speaks only<br/>
with perfect reason.<br/>
To cling to but one “love”<br/>
you have miscreated<br/>
is surely to be unreasonable,<br/>
for you have learned<br/>
that the symbols of the world<br/>
can be but the symbols of death.<br/>
Death is no longer your will,<br/>
but Life.

I am come again unto you<br/>
that you might have Life,<br/>
and this more abundantly.<br/>
Learn well, then,<br/>
to ask before each choice:<br/>
“Does this value the symbols of death,<br/>
or of Life?”

Abiding in innocent honesty,<br/>
you will realize<br/>
that the Comforter’s guidance<br/>
is immediate,<br/>
and uncompromising.

Herein will be revealed to you<br/>
the final meaning of my teaching:

<p markdown="1" class="indent">Take no thought,<br/>
for the Father knows<br/>
you have need of these things.</p>

In this,<br/>
the next step *has* been taken.

Released from the insane belief in sacrifice<br/>
and loss,<br/>
not a single “love”<br/>
does the servant keep for himself.

Knowing<br/>
with a certainty beyond question<br/>
who walks with him<br/>
in the way that he chooses to go,<br/>
he steps with gentle authority<br/>
on the path set before him.

Caring not for what she will wear<br/>
nor for what she shall eat,<br/>
she listens for the Voice<br/>
of the Holy One.

Because her prayer is only<br/>
for that which can reflect<br/>
the Father’s perfect Love through her,<br/>
her joy is forever complete.<br/>
And the Comforter’s guidance<br/>
is without reproach,<br/>
revealing the gifts<br/>
that are brought to serve<br/>
the one desire that alone arises<br/>
in the holy mind of the servant:

<p markdown="1" class="indent">That all I do<br/>
and all I say,<br/>
that all I think<br/>
and all I share,<br/>
that all I be, do, and have,<br/>
reflect the radiance,<br/>
the joy,<br/>
the grace,<br/>
the laughter,<br/>
the compassion,<br/>
the power,<br/>
the vision,<br/>
and the mastery<br/>
of my Father’s one creation:<br/>
Christ, I AM!</p>

And the things that she wears<br/>
and the things that she eats<br/>
whisper to the world<br/>
of the Love with which the Father<br/>
has restored his precious child<br/>
to her rightful place.

Whenever you are not wholly joyous,<br/>
it is because you have chosen wrongly.<br/>
For from choice there follows action,<br/>
and from action always experience.

For those with ears to hear,<br/>
let them hear:<br/>
He who has learned that death is unreal<br/>
gladly releases the symbols of death<br/>
even within the illusions of time,<br/>
down to the least jot and tittle.

The awakened servant,<br/>
having truly chosen<br/>
to teach *only* Love<br/>
because Love alone is desired,<br/>
moves from the silent foundation of union<br/>
unto Life *everlasting*,<br/>
teaching only the symbols of Life,<br/>
for by teaching he learns<br/>
and by giving he receives.

The Way, then,<br/>
*is* easy,<br/>
and without effort.

From the thoughts<br/>
you would choose to think,<br/>
to what you would eat<br/>
and what you would wear,<br/>
*take no thought of yourself,*<br/>
but receive the guidance<br/>
of the One sent unto you of the Father,<br/>
because He has loved you<br/>
from before the foundation of *all* worlds.

Herein,<br/>
while time seems to last for you,<br/>
are all things translated<br/>
into that which reflects<br/>
the holy of holies,<br/>
and what was hidden is now revealed.

I gave even the body<br/>
that it might be glorified<br/>
in glad tribute to my Father.<br/>
For she who gives all,<br/>
receives all.

Remember then,<br/>
what I say unto you now:<br/>
If your brother is hungry,<br/>
*you* are without nourishment,<br/>
and if your sister is alone,<br/>
*you* are separated from the feast.<br/>
Because there is<br/>
nothing outside you;<br/>
you are the good shepherd.<br/>
And l ask only for you<br/>
to accept the truth<br/>
that because you have chosen<br/>
to awaken to your own call,<br/>
the time is at hand<br/>
for embracing with me<br/>
all that is given you,<br/>
that the world<br/>
might be restored in us,<br/>
the holy, unlimited,<br/>
and *only* begotten child of God.

If you will do this with me,<br/>
all things *will* be embraced,<br/>
and Love will light all things.

Be you, therefore, of good courage.<br/>
Love one another<br/>
as I love you, always.<br/>
Rejoice,<br/>
and celebrate with one another often,<br/>
for if there are two or more<br/>
gathered together to embrace the world,<br/>
I *am* in the midst of them.

We walk now with certainty,<br/>
holding not one “love”<br/>
back from the teacher<br/>
who would heal all wounds,<br/>
and translate even the body –<br/>
the symbol of ego –<br/>
into that which reflects only Light<br/>
to a world redeemed<br/>
from the dream of separation.

The final lesson has been learned,<br/>
and now will be gladly lived:

<p markdown="1" class="indent">There is nothing outside me.</p>

Now, it is finished.

He who understands these words,<br/>
lives them,<br/>
and his life is a dance of devotion<br/>
without ceasing,<br/>
unlimited forever,<br/>
for he knows what comes to pass.

The happy dream dawns now,<br/>
having been placed safely within you<br/>
by God himself<br/>
even as you were –<br/>
for but one brief moment –<br/>
distracted by a tiny, mad idea.

My peace<br/>
I give unto you.<br/>
Not as the world gives,<br/>
do I give unto you.<br/>
Because you have received me,<br/>
you give me to the world.<br/>
Because you give me,<br/>
do you eternally receive me,<br/>
forever,<br/>
and ever.

Peace be unto you,<br/>
beloved,<br/>
precious,<br/>
and ancient<br/>
friend.

<p markdown="1" class="indent">Amen</p>
