<p markdown="1" class="top"><span class="dropcaps">H</span>e who looks upon me<br/>
and truly *sees* me<br/>
has learned<br/>
to look upon himself<br/>
*as our Father knows him.*</p>

She who sees me,<br/>
thus has she seen<br/>
the One who has sent me,<br/>
even as she, too,<br/>
has been sent of the Father<br/>
to proclaim but this:

<p markdown="1" class="indent">Love alone is Real.<br/>
God is but Love.<br/>
Therefore,<br/>
God __is__.</p>

Herein lies the meaning of my words,<br/>
read often,<br/>
yet often not understood:

<p class="indent">It is not possible<br/>
for what is Real to be threatened,<br/>
nor is it possible<br/>
for what is unreal to exist.</p>

Because you know *only* that you exist,<br/>
you must be in God,<br/>
and cannot be threatened<br/>
in any way.

Nor does the illumined mind<br/>
behold the place where it begins<br/>
and God ends.

For what alone is Real<br/>
is without beginning or end.

Yet,<br/>
always does such a mind<br/>
recognize that it is created,<br/>
and not Creator,<br/>
knowing not the unfathomable Source<br/>
of its beginning.

This recognition<br/>
is the seat of humility.<br/>
Humility begets<br/>
the recognition of freedom,<br/>
and in perfect freedom<br/>
lies true power:

<p markdown="1" class="indent">I can do absolutely nothing,<br/>
nor need I do anything,<br/>
for the One who has sent me<br/>
alone does all things.</p>

Joy flows gently from the heart<br/>
of one who has awakened.

It is a joy<br/>
neither created nor possessed,<br/>
but *allowed*.<br/>
Flowing as the radiant extension<br/>
of a Light that meets no obstacle,<br/>
it attracts those<br/>
who would choose to Remember,<br/>
and behold themselves reflected<br/>
in the one who has awakened.

When you see me<br/>
in the face of your brother and sister,<br/>
you become the mirror<br/>
of their only Reality,<br/>
and in *you* can they know Christ.

Therefore,<br/>
your relationship with each of them<br/>
is the means of your salvation,<br/>
and your only appropriate gift to them<br/>
is to be one who has refused to tolerate<br/>
the error of separation<br/>
in yourself,<br/>
offering to them the gift of *their* perfect –<br/>
and holy –<br/>
reflection.

The holiest place on Earth is, indeed,<br/>
wherever an ancient hatred<br/>
has become a present love.<br/>
Hatred *is* ancient,<br/>
being born of separation;<br/>
having a beginning,<br/>
it must have an end.

Love,<br/>
being of God,<br/>
knows neither beginning nor end.

To offer your brother and sister<br/>
the gift of your holiness<br/>
is to offer the gift of what is eternal.<br/>
Eternity must speak to them of Grace,<br/>
and by Grace and Grace alone<br/>
the world is overcome.

Join with me<br/>
and offer our friends<br/>
the holiness<br/>
you share with me<br/>
from before the foundations<br/>
of the world.

Nothing beyond this<br/>
can be found,<br/>
and in this<br/>
there is nothing lacking.<br/>
All searching has ended,<br/>
and in what is eternal<br/>
there can be nothing you want still.

In giving your Self,<br/>
you must remember your Self.<br/>
This alone<br/>
is the straight and narrow path,<br/>
the bridge given you when,<br/>
in a distant and forgotten past,<br/>
you looked upon one insane thought,<br/>
*and failed to laugh*.

Your seriousness<br/>
made the insanity of separation<br/>
seem real to you.

Gone now is all fear,<br/>
for we see together<br/>
that what is unreal<br/>
cannot possibly exist.

Now,<br/>
we are safe.<br/>
Now,<br/>
peace has come.<br/>
Giving this alone to everyone,<br/>
we have received it forever.

The servant gives,<br/>
and therefore receives.

I have said<br/>
that I come to gather my friends<br/>
to myself.

Gather those who are given to you,<br/>
and it is enough.<br/>
And because you have received<br/>
the ones I send to you<br/>
in order that they might behold<br/>
in your holiness<br/>
their true reflection,<br/>
verily,<br/>
you have received me.<br/>
And our friendship must be eternal,<br/>
being established in God.

When I said,<br/>
“Go, and do likewise,”<br/>
it is just this<br/>
to which I was referring.

<p markdown="1" class="indent">For as many as received Him,<br/>
gave He the power to become<br/>
the Sons and Daughters<br/>
of the Living God.</p>

This can only mean<br/>
that when you give the gift<br/>
of *your* holiness,<br/>
you have paid witness to the truth<br/>
that you *have* received me.

Because you have allowed me<br/>
to raise you from the dead,<br/>
*you* are the one<br/>
in whom I now live,<br/>
and the only logical meaning<br/>
of the Second Coming<br/>
is witnessed by those<br/>
who are given to you.

If but one of our precious friends<br/>
sees that I live in you,<br/>
*the whole of Creation is uplifted.*

You are sent forth “in my name”<br/>
to extend the power to awaken<br/>
unto all who will be sent to you,<br/>
and in you will they be provided<br/>
with the opportunity to see themselves<br/>
as they are held eternally<br/>
in the mind of God.

Remember<br/>
that in the Kingdom<br/>
there is no effort.<br/>
Because you are awake in me,<br/>
*you need do nothing,*<br/>
yet not one thing<br/>
shall be left undone.<br/>
And what I ask of you<br/>
you will accomplish,<br/>
because our wills are joined.

It is not possible that you fail,<br/>
for this would mean<br/>
that God has failed me,<br/>
and my Father fails not his Son.

The choice for Love,<br/>
which is the end of fear,<br/>
is the choice to see<br/>
with the eyes of Christ:

<p markdown="1" class="ident">God has not failed me,<br/>
and I cannot fail those<br/>
who are sent to me,<br/>
because the One who has sent me<br/>
lives in me.</p>

Giving them to God –<br/>
by seeing that Christ is in them –<br/>
they are received *through* me,<br/>
but *by* God,<br/>
who receives his own.

All praise to the One<br/>
beyond all comprehension!<br/>
I am *not* the doer,<br/>
I am *not* the maker.<br/>
I AM<br/>
but the humble servant,<br/>
allowing<br/>
the witnessing of Love in me,<br/>
*because* Christ lives in me.<br/>
And this *is* enough.

What perfection the world reveals!

What sublime beauty<br/>
do all things show me!

My joy<br/>
is beyond measure,<br/>
my pleasure unending!

Weariness is gone,<br/>
and the dance begun.

The song of the One<br/>
in whom I dwell<br/>
lifts me gently in dancing!

The leaves tossed in the wind,<br/>
the laughter of a child,<br/>
the radiance of the farthest star,<br/>
each one who stands before me,<br/>
these are the partners<br/>
with whom I dance!

Perfection shines forth<br/>
in all things;<br/>
the weaver of the dance is trusted.

If I am with you in this moment,<br/>
we dance as friends in holiness,<br/>
for we cannot fail to be<br/>
where God has asked us to be.

The eternal melody shifts,<br/>
and moves on.<br/>
I dance with the one sent unto me,<br/>
yet lose not the one<br/>
who appears to have gone.<br/>
For minds that have joined in Love<br/>
can in no way be separate,<br/>
one from another.

Fail not to dance, oh holy Son of God!<br/>
Know you not what comes to pass?

The crucifixion is past,<br/>
the resurrection completed,<br/>
and ascension now descends upon us<br/>
as a gentle dove,<br/>
lifting us to the abode<br/>
of the One who is but Love!

Forget you not to dance<br/>
with every breath you breathe,<br/>
for Love waits upon your welcome,<br/>
and desires to be heard<br/>
with every spoken word!

*You* are the one sent forth from God!<br/>
*You* are the one<br/>
in whom He remains<br/>
eternally well pleased!<br/>
*You* are the one in whom I live,<br/>
and reveal myself to the world!<br/>
*You*, precious friend,<br/>
you are as I AM!

In your joyousness<br/>
is my laughter heard.<br/>
In your giving<br/>
am I received.

Dance you therefore with passion,<br/>
not for the things of the world,<br/>
but for that which alone is Real<br/>
and cannot be taken from us.

Because Light<br/>
is reborn in *you*,<br/>
your brothers and sisters rejoice!<br/>
You have become their salvation<br/>
and they, yours.<br/>
Their gratitude is joined with mine,<br/>
and our voices are raised as one:<br/>
“God *is*!”

The ancient melody is heard,<br/>
the sacred and happy dance enjoined.<br/>
Because we dance,<br/>
we *do* know what comes to pass.<br/>
We are the bringers of Heaven to Earth,<br/>
that the things of the world<br/>
might be forgotten,<br/>
and the purpose of time<br/>
might be completed.

The translation<br/>
of a brief and harmless dream<br/>
is finished,<br/>
and all things are quietly returned.

The Sonship is remembered as One<br/>
and the first, *is* first,<br/>
eternally.

The field of obstacles<br/>
through which the dreamer stumbles<br/>
are but various symbols<br/>
of the one thing<br/>
he seems to have created in error.<br/>
For appearances *are* error<br/>
and nothing more.

I have often said –<br/>
in many ways<br/>
and through many channels –<br/>
that there is but one lesson<br/>
you need learn:

<p markdown="1" class="indent">There is nothing outside you.</p>

As with all expressions of wisdom,<br/>
this statement is true<br/>
at many levels.

Levels appear to exist<br/>
as long as the dream seems to remain.<br/>
Because you are awake,<br/>
the idea of levels<br/>
no longer pertains to you.

Therefore,<br/>
the “secret” of this work<br/>
is now revealed;<br/>
it is given to those<br/>
who are the teachers of God,<br/>
for only they will truly<br/>
and clearly<br/>
understand it.

In knowing that they<br/>
do understand it,<br/>
they will know they have received<br/>
the “sign from Heaven”<br/>
I once promised them.<br/>
Now<br/>
they are free<br/>
to take up their cross<br/>
and follow me,<br/>
for where I have gone<br/>
they now can come.<br/>
And the whole thought structure<br/>
of the world<br/>
has been reversed in them.

Because it is completed in them,<br/>
it shall quickly be completed<br/>
in the entire Sonship.<br/>
This are they certain of,<br/>
and our voices *are* raised as one.

<div markdown="1" class="center">

</div>

All things perceived<br/>
arise only within the mind.<br/>
Because all minds are joined,<br/>
whatever is perceived has arisen<br/>
in *one* mind,<br/>
shared equally by all.

To say “all minds are joined”<br/>
is to say only that there is one mind,<br/>
and the things of Heaven and Earth<br/>
arise<br/>
and pass away<br/>
within it.

You have learned<br/>
that the body’s senses<br/>
have led you to believe<br/>
that everything<br/>
beyond the boundary<br/>
of the body<br/>
is outside you.<br/>
But you have recognized<br/>
that *this cannot be true.*

It has always made sense to you<br/>
that your thoughts are not outside you.<br/>
It has required great courage<br/>
to learn the truth<br/>
that your brother’s or sister’s thought<br/>
is *also not outside you.*

Until recently,<br/>
you have remained fearful<br/>
of taking the next logical step.<br/>
While just a few traces of guilt remained<br/>
you have feared what you perceived<br/>
as an overwhelming responsibility.

But because the Father<br/>
has taken the final step for you,<br/>
you abide in the perfect safety<br/>
where the next step<br/>
is no longer fearful.

I have said that the Holy Spirit<br/>
never teaches you<br/>
what you are still<br/>
fearful of learning.<br/>
Because of this, two things follow.

First:<br/>
Before you chose<br/>
to be awake in me,<br/>
it appeared that a prayer<br/>
could fail to be answered.<br/>
This was because you feared<br/>
receiving the answer,<br/>
and so it was not given you.<br/>
But what you were willing to receive<br/>
always *was* given.

Now,<br/>
because you are willing<br/>
to receive all,<br/>
all *is* given you.<br/>
Yet,<br/>
because your eyes are open,<br/>
you no longer pray<br/>
“in vain.”<br/>
This means only<br/>
that you have gone beyond<br/>
the childish prayers for those things<br/>
you once believed you needed<br/>
to save you<br/>
from what you thought you feared.<br/>
Because fear is gone,<br/>
childish prayer has vanished.

Awake in our Remembrance,<br/>
you have learned to pray<br/>
only for the Atonement of the Sonship,<br/>
and have extended to me<br/>
your willingness to join with me<br/>
in answering the only true prayer.

This has required<br/>
the re-learning of trust,<br/>
and trust is the inevitable fruit<br/>
of the forgiveness<br/>
you have extended to the world,<br/>
of which you are a worthy part.

This willingness<br/>
has given me permission<br/>
to dismantle the “mansions”<br/>
you had made in error;<br/>
every teacher of God<br/>
has faced crucifixion.

Through forgiveness,<br/>
and mastery<br/>
of the keys to the Kingdom,<br/>
you have passed through<br/>
the eye of the needle<br/>
to join me in the resurrection.<br/>
All things *have* been made new again!

Second:<br/>
Because you are now taking<br/>
the next step,<br/>
it must mean that the fear<br/>
which had kept<br/>
what you prayed for from you<br/>
is *no longer present.*

This can only mean<br/>
that my promise has been kept:<br/>
I have given you my strength<br/>
until yours has become<br/>
as certain as mine.<br/>
Because you know that I live in you,<br/>
your strength *is* as certain as mine,<br/>
and the next step<br/>
we can now take together.

For those who have chosen<br/>
to learn this curriculum<br/>
through my *Course in Miracles,*<br/>
you will clearly remember<br/>
that it was not designed<br/>
to answer every question<br/>
a teacher of God might have.<br/>
It could not do so,<br/>
being only a teaching device<br/>
aimed at a specific goal:<br/>
peace.

Peace is the necessary foundation<br/>
from which the teacher of God<br/>
moves to complete the Atonement<br/>
on Earth,<br/>
*as it is already completed in Heaven.*

Now<br/>
are we ready<br/>
to take the necessary step,<br/>
and accept the final meaning<br/>
of the one lesson:

<p markdown="1" class="indent">There is nothing outside you.</p>

You are your brother’s keeper<br/>
because you *are* your brother.

The translation<br/>
of the unhappy dream of separation<br/>
into the final,<br/>
happy dream –<br/>
the final manifestation in time –<br/>
requires that it be accomplished<br/>
*through you.*

Those of you<br/>
who understand clearly<br/>
the meaning of this work<br/>
are those in whom all preparation<br/>
is completed.<br/>
You have learned<br/>
that the purpose of your life<br/>
is *exactly the same as was mine,*<br/>
to demonstrate that, with God,<br/>
all things are not simply possible,<br/>
but inevitable.

You are now ready<br/>
to become a *living demonstration*<br/>
of *complete mastery*.

Because all resistance is gone<br/>
(for what is ego but this?),<br/>
the discipline necessary<br/>
for the completion of your demonstration<br/>
is as an “easy yoke.”<br/>
It is a discipline<br/>
that must joyfully touch<br/>
upon every aspect of your life.

It is through you<br/>
that the simple and natural righteousness<br/>
of God’s “laws”<br/>
can be demonstrated.

Mastery in *every* aspect<br/>
of the life given unto you<br/>
is the only way you can teach<br/>
your brother and your sister<br/>
that God *is*.

This means that now<br/>
we look together<br/>
beyond the mind’s tendency<br/>
to separate itself from the world<br/>
by looking upon aspects of life<br/>
not yet mastered,<br/>
and decreeing them to be simply illusions.<br/>
While this is true,<br/>
it is not appropriate to conclude<br/>
that they be left untransformed.

To those with ears to hear:<br/>
It is simply not possible to transcend<br/>
what you refuse to acknowledge<br/>
and embrace.<br/>
Denial is but the ploy of ego<br/>
to ensure that your Self<br/>
remains imprisoned,<br/>
and *the ego* remains enthroned.

Again I ask of you:

<p markdown="1" class="indent">What do you __want__, truly?</p>
