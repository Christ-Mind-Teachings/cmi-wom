It appears an odd word,<br/>
yet within it lies the meaning of sacrifice,<br/>
of Love,<br/>
of true Being.</p>

What, then,<br/>
can we say of sacrifice?

The cloak of ignorance<br/>
has been cast off,<br/>
the darkness of a solitary thought<br/>
dissolved in the simple brilliance<br/>
of a Light far brighter<br/>
than ten thousand suns,<br/>
and the soul of one<br/>
who has seen through the vanity<br/>
of useless wandering<br/>
is again restored<br/>
to the place from which<br/>
it has not ever ventured forth.

The holy one<br/>
is again become first,<br/>
and sees that nowhere<br/>
is there to be found a second.

<div markdown="1" class="indent">
I AM the first-born of my Father,<br/>
standing before all things. <br/>
Moving not,<br/>
I travel far. <br/>
Embracing all things, I touch myself.

Creation arises within me.<br/>
I AM the first and the last,<br/>
the alpha and omega.

Fulfilled begond all measure,<br/>
I need nothing.<br/>
Possessing the whole of Creation,<br/>
I desire nothing.

That which has been,<br/>
I AM.<br/>
That which is,<br/>
I AM.<br/>
That which shall be,<br/>
I AM.

Looking far,<br/>
I behold not my ancient beginning.<br/>
Gazing near,<br/>
I see not my end.

I AM a circle of heavenly Light<br/>
embracing all things,<br/>
knowing all things,<br/>
allowing all things.

My splendor<br/>
fills the vastness of space<br/>
and is contained<br/>
between two thoughts.

The wind is birthed<br/>
from my holy breath,<br/>
and carries my glory<br/>
to all far places.

I AM the power<br/>
by which all dreams are dreamt.

I AM the purpose<br/>
of all actions performed.

I AM the Way,<br/>
the Truth, and the Life,<br/>
and the whole of Creation<br/>
returns to the Father through me.

I AM the praying,<br/>
the prayer,<br/>
and the answer.

I AM the dream,<br/>
the dreamer,<br/>
and her awakening.

I AM the sin,<br/>
the sinner,<br/>
and the salvation.

I AM the vast ocean<br/>
from which<br/>
the dew drop arises.

I AM the tear<br/>
on the cheek of a newborn<br/>
who brings me into form and time.

I AM the words<br/>
before your eyes,<br/>
the writer,<br/>
and the one who even now reads.

I AM the one dreamer<br/>
bold enough to imagine<br/>
the illusion of separation,<br/>
and the one worthy<br/>
of releasing the allure of sleep.

I AM,<br/>
simply, that,<br/>
I AM.
</div>

It is this<br/>
that the awakened Son proclaims,<br/>
without a trace of thought<br/>
to obscure the brilliance and purity<br/>
of his being.

She looks for herself,<br/>
and sees only<br/>
the Father.

He reaches to himself,<br/>
and embraces only<br/>
the whole of Creation.

The glass,<br/>
once filled with a momentary thought<br/>
of imaginary sustenance,<br/>
is again<br/>
become the emptiness<br/>
overflowing with living waters.

The holy chalice<br/>
is raised to her lips.<br/>
She drinks eternally,<br/>
and is satisfied.

Herein<br/>
is the meaning of sacrifice:<br/>
Never has there existed<br/>
what must be eternally unreal,<br/>
and what is *not*<br/>
can be neither lost<br/>
nor sacrificed.

What, then,<br/>
would you cling<br/>
so tightly unto?

<div markdown="1" class="center">
![line](/public/img/wom/line4.jpg)
{: .omit}
</div>

Servantship<br/>
is that which arises<br/>
when the death<br/>
of what could never possibly be<br/>
is irrevocably allowed.

It is the perfect heritage<br/>
extended from the Father<br/>
to the Son,<br/>
and is of one substance<br/>
with the Mystery<br/>
that our Heavenly Father is.

Servantship<br/>
requires only<br/>
the *enactment* of sacrifice,<br/>
that sacrifice which is,<br/>
from the beginning,<br/>
already completed:<br/>
the Grace of God.

Our choice to remember<br/>
who we are<br/>
is the enactment<br/>
of that sacrifice<br/>
already made in Heaven.

Sacrifice,<br/>
when completed,<br/>
gives rise to the birth of Love<br/>
both unconditional<br/>
and incomprehensible,<br/>
a Love which can only come<br/>
to be truly recognized<br/>
when any mind finally,<br/>
and irrevocably,<br/>
chooses to awaken<br/>
from the senseless dream<br/>
of the dreamer.

It is not a love tainted<br/>
by being directed<br/>
to the objects of the world,<br/>
nor felt only when a mind<br/>
momentarily perceives a satisfaction<br/>
born of the temporary *organization*<br/>
of the objects and events it embraces,<br/>
for no such love<br/>
is truly unconditional.

Therefore,<br/>
such love perceived<br/>
is not Love at all.

But what arises<br/>
is that self-same Love<br/>
that is already with us<br/>
from before time *is*,<br/>
the Love from which the<br/>
Son of God is birthed,<br/>
the Love which has already<br/>
fulfilled the Atonement<br/>
required by the brief -<br/>
and meaningless -<br/>
thought of separation.

It is that Love<br/>
which *is*<br/>
the very presence of God,<br/>
who is Love itself,<br/>
and *only* this.

Love seeks not for itself,<br/>
but finds its completion<br/>
in its eternal<br/>
and unreserved extension.

It is a Love<br/>
enacted by the Son<br/>
which unceasingly mirrors<br/>
the Love by which the Father<br/>
has begotten the Son.

It is a Love<br/>
which gives when asked<br/>
and holds nothing for itself.

It is a Love<br/>
that embraces all things,<br/>
for it sees no separation<br/>
in the whole of Creation.

It is a Love<br/>
that touches all who behold it<br/>
with a gentleness and certainty<br/>
whose taste is sweet above honey;<br/>
it quenches the thirst of the soul.

And this,<br/>
without effort,<br/>
for it is a Love<br/>
that extends from -<br/>
and to -<br/>
true Being.

Seeing naught but the substance<br/>
of what alone is Real<br/>
in all that its eyes rest upon,<br/>
it severs with the sword of wisdom<br/>
the stranglehold of illusions<br/>
from the heart<br/>
of the one who beholds<br/>
the person of the arisen Christ.

It is not a Love<br/>
to be created,<br/>
but a Love that has finally<br/>
*been allowed*,<br/>
rising without resistance<br/>
from the soil of perfect surrender.

The dreamer,<br/>
vanquished and reborn,<br/>
decrees:

<div markdown="1" class="indent">
I live,<br/>
yet not I,<br/>
but Christ,<br/>
dwells as me.
</div>

And the Word is made flesh,<br/>
and dwells among us.

*In* the world,<br/>
but not *of* the world,<br/>
for the world is overcome<br/>
not by effort,<br/>
but by Grace...<br/>
the simple correction<br/>
of one mistaken perception.

<div markdown="1" class="center">

</div>

Who, then,
is the servant?<br/>
What is she likened unto?

The servant is *free*.<br/>
No longer fettered<br/>
to the tiny fears<br/>
once seen as unscalable walls<br/>
reaching to block<br/>
the Light of the Son,<br/>
he loves not the things of the world,<br/>
for they hold no value.

The servant is *humble*.<br/>
No longer fettered<br/>
to the false arrogance<br/>
that once was made<br/>
to shield her from her aloneness,<br/>
she clings not to false knowledge,<br/>
for she knows that *she does not know*,<br/>
nor does she need to.<br/>
Trusting all things,<br/>
allowing all things,<br/>
she transcends all things<br/>
by first loving and embracing<br/>
all things.<br/>
And their passing<br/>
leaves not a trace upon her.

The servant is *capable*.<br/>
With no anxiety<br/>
for the things of tomorrow,<br/>
he enacts<br/>
the incomprehensible Love<br/>
of the Father *in this moment*.<br/>
Innocent as a child,<br/>
he considers not limitation,<br/>
for he sees with certainty that:

<div markdown="1" class="indent">
The works I do<br/>
you also shall do,<br/>
and greater works than these<br/>
shall you do.
</div>

He knows simply<br/>
that of himself he does nothing,<br/>
but the Father through him<br/>
does all things.<br/>
Where could incapacity arise?

Emptied of herself,<br/>
the servant effortlessly<br/>
dons the cloak<br/>
given her of the Father,<br/>
whether the cloak of this world<br/>
or another.<br/>
She moves freely<br/>
between Heaven and Earth,<br/>
rejoicing always<br/>
as the embodiment<br/>
of prayer without ceasing:<br/>
“Holy Father, *now* there is Light!”

The servant<br/>
is likened unto one<br/>
who has journeyed to a distant land,<br/>
for his master had commanded him:

<div markdown="1" class="indent">
Go, and share with all<br/>
who have ears to hear<br/>
and eyes to see.

Give to them of my abundance,<br/>
and give freely.
</div>

Now,<br/>
when the servant heard,<br/>
she went immediately forth<br/>
and was found -<br/>
from waking to sleeping -<br/>
to be doing<br/>
as her master had asked.

And it came to pass<br/>
that many who received<br/>
secretly laughed<br/>
at the folly of the servant.<br/>
Many thought him mad,<br/>
and many more<br/>
either lost or discarded<br/>
what he shared with them.

Only a few,<br/>
having heard,<br/>
received what was given to them<br/>
and went and did likewise,<br/>
for in their hearing<br/>
they became like the servant,<br/>
and what they gave away<br/>
was returned to them tenfold.

So joyous in her task<br/>
was the servant<br/>
that she could hear not<br/>
the judgments of the small-minded.

<div markdown="1" class="indent">
Will you choose to have ears to hear?
</div>

The servant<br/>
is one who has<br/>
transcended history.

Quite literally,<br/>
she looks upon her past<br/>
and sees it, indeed,<br/>
as having *passed* away,<br/>
dissolved as mist<br/>
before the arising sun<br/>
from deep and forested valleys.

Not one dark corner remains<br/>
in the valleys of the mind,<br/>
cut and shaped by the forces<br/>
of limiting thought.

Rivers of radiant Light<br/>
flow unimpeded now,<br/>
emanating from the ocean of God’s Love,<br/>
cascading waterfalls of vision<br/>
that embrace the whole of Creation.

Though disguised in simplicity,<br/>
the servant sees<br/>
his every loving gesture<br/>
touching the farthest star,<br/>
and participating in the miracle<br/>
of the Atonement.

The servant<br/>
always recognizes his own.<br/>
Herein is revealed<br/>
the true body of Christ,<br/>
the mystical Church<br/>
which far transcends<br/>
the loftiest of theologies.<br/>
Herein is revealed<br/>
the essence of brotherhood.

The servant<br/>
seeks out her own<br/>
and celebrates with them<br/>
*without ceasing*,<br/>
for awakened minds<br/>
are eternally joined as one.

The servant is *gentle*.<br/>
Clinging not<br/>
to what is not given her to do,<br/>
neither anger<br/>
nor impatience<br/>
arises.

The servant *trusts*.<br/>
Embracing all things,<br/>
having given the world<br/>
up to his Father,<br/>
he is content in *this* moment.<br/>
The whole is present in the part,<br/>
and the part embraces the whole.<br/>
Forgetting not Heaven,<br/>
he blesses Earth,<br/>
and even his smile illuminates the world.

With nothing to do,<br/>
she does nothing.<br/>
With all things to do,<br/>
she accomplishes all things -<br/>
yet sees not a trace of distinction<br/>
between these.

The servant is at *peace*.<br/>
But more:<br/>
he *is* peace.

Receiving doubt,<br/>
he returns Love.<br/>
Receiving judgment,<br/>
she returns Love.<br/>
Receiving the projections of fear,<br/>
he returns Love.<br/>
Receiving love<br/>
not yet made wholly pure,<br/>
she returns Love.

Receiving Love<br/>
given purely,<br/>
he allows himself to receive it.

Abiding in unbroken union<br/>
with God,<br/>
she receives Love<br/>
without ceasing.

Though the world gives<br/>
and takes away,<br/>
his cup is always filled;<br/>
he drinks deeply with every breath.<br/>
Satiated,<br/>
he laughs at the world’s illusions,<br/>
and his laughter heals the world.

The servant<br/>
is simply incomprehensible<br/>
to the perceptions of the world.<br/>
For where the world perceives lack,<br/>
the servant knows unlimited abundance.<br/>
Where the world perceives struggle,<br/>
the servant knows perfect harmony.<br/>
Where the world perceives<br/>
the pressure of time,<br/>
the servant knows the grace of eternity.

No reconciliation is possible,<br/>
for the things of Heaven and Earth<br/>
shall pass away,<br/>
but the things of God shall not.

And the first -<br/>
made so by the worldshall<br/>
be last.

The last -<br/>
being the creation of God -<br/>
shall again be made first<br/>
in the mind of the awakened<br/>
joyous,<br/>
servant of God,<br/>
*who is but Love*.

As it was in the beginning,<br/>
is now,<br/>
and forever shall be.<br/>

What, then,<br/>
can the qualities<br/>
of genuine service<br/>
be likened unto?<br/>
Observe the waters<br/>
that flow from the highest mountains,<br/>
winding, cascading, twisting, churning,<br/>
resting inevitably in the sea.

Their destination<br/>
is neither hoped for, nor imagined.<br/>
It is *known*,<br/>
resting always in certainty.<br/>
And once the journey has begun,<br/>
the end is certain.

The river begins<br/>
as but a drop of rain<br/>
that falls from the heavens<br/>
freely given.

It forms itself in places unseen<br/>
and is shaped into a constant flow<br/>
that is not interrupted.

Seemingly shaped by the earth it touches,<br/>
it becomes the shaper of waterfalls<br/>
and canyons;<br/>
and what river of living waters<br/>
does not speak of beauty<br/>
to its beholder?

The river nurtures<br/>
all that it touches<br/>
with the very sustenance of Life.<br/>
It recognizes not obstacles to its journey,<br/>
but -<br/>
by embracing them -<br/>
overcomes them.<br/>
Even the sound of its passing<br/>
brings respite to those who listen.

It laments not<br/>
when others draw from it,<br/>
seemingly without gratitude,<br/>
for it knows its Source to be unlimited.

The secret of its peace,<br/>
and of its certain power, is this:<br/>
*It already abides at one with the sea*,<br/>
having arisen from it,<br/>
and returning always to it.

No veil of illusion<br/>
has arisen in its being<br/>
to create a sense of separation.<br/>
Therefore,<br/>
its journey begins in its certain end.

Let your service be given<br/>
like unto the rivers of life<br/>
that flow from the highest mountains<br/>
to the sea.

Think not *you* must know<br/>
the nature of the journey,<br/>
nor that *you* must judge<br/>
whether the twists and turns<br/>
are acceptable.

For unto you there is given<br/>
the gift of one teacher<br/>
whose guidance never errs.<br/>
His Voice is certain,<br/>
his presence eternal.<br/>
Have I not said unto you:<br/>
“I will send you a Comforter?”

Yet,<br/>
the one whom I send<br/>
was received by me of our Father.<br/>
Because I have received Him,<br/>
He is given unto you equally.<br/>
Like an ancient melody,<br/>
his Voice is as a gentle song<br/>
at once familiar;<br/>
silence is the threshold<br/>
that carries the heart<br/>
to the inner chamber of the Holy One.

To give truly,<br/>
one must give all they have.

For to give<br/>
while holding one part back<br/>
is to believe one has *not* all things.<br/>
And to she who believes she has not,<br/>
much will be taken,<br/>
while to she who knows she has all,<br/>
even more shall be added,<br/>
and her giving shall be unlimited<br/>
and without end.

<p class="indent">She who gives all receives all.</p>

The true servant gives even this:<br/>
all traces of attachment<br/>
to the fruit of her giving.<br/>
For her giving has been already seen<br/>
to be from the Father,<br/>
and so the fruits are given to her.

Thus the servant proclaims:<br/>
“Why do you call me good?<br/>
There is only one who is good:<br/>
God, who is but Love.<br/>
And if you would truly receive<br/>
what I would give you,<br/>
go, and do likewise.”

Hear again:

<p class="indent">He who gives all, receives all.</p>

The servant<br/>
gives as he has been given,<br/>
but remembers it not.<br/>
Caring not for the accolades of the world,<br/>
he collects no ribbons,<br/>
and keeps no trophy.<br/>
But the face of Christ<br/>
seen in each he serves<br/>
is etched in his awareness forever;<br/>
he remembers them<br/>
and gives thanks to the Father,<br/>
for the servant lives<br/>
the simplest of truths:

<p class="indent">My brothers and sisters are my salvation.</p>

The servant knows she fixes nothing.<br/>
Seeing not a fearful world,<br/>
she does not deliver it from “evil.”<br/>
Looking not upon illness,<br/>
she calls not herself a healer.

Herein,<br/>
learn the secret of the miraculous:<br/>
The servant does nothing<br/>
save to extend Love<br/>
to the Christ who dwells in another,<br/>
having learned to see<br/>
past the appearances<br/>
that are the world;<br/>
and the one who is ill<br/>
recognizes that the servant<br/>
has recognized her<br/>
*as she is*, and decrees:<br/>
“I am seen as I AM,<br/>
and release my illusions now.”

Love heals,<br/>
and Love alone.

Those unaccustomed to miracles<br/>
run after the servant, asking:<br/>
“How do you do these things?”<br/>
To which the servant replies:<br/>
“Love has done these things.<br/>
Of myself,<br/>
I only asked that my Father<br/>
correct my perception of you.”

Love will flow through any mind<br/>
that asks for<br/>
and allows<br/>
the correction of its perceptions.

How, then,<br/>
does the servant serve?

By being *only* the presence of Love.

The extension of Love,<br/>
untainted by the thought of a doer,<br/>
is the quality of genuine service,<br/>
a reflection in this world<br/>
of the Love which begets eternally<br/>
the holy and only begotten child of God.
