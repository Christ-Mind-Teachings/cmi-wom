<p markdown="1" class="top"><span class="dropcaps">S</span>*ervantship*<br/>
It appears an odd word,<br/>
yet within it lies the meaning of sacrifice,<br/>
of Love,<br/>
of true Being.</p>

Servantship is a *vocation*<br/>
to which one is called,<br/>
not by a God who exists apart from you,<br/>
but by that one true God<br/>
who abides eternally<br/>
in the Heart of one’s heart,<br/>
and is forever the Soul of one’s soul.

For the one true God<br/>
is your only Reality,<br/>
and in this does the recognition dawn<br/>
that *you* -<br/>
who would insist<br/>
on the smallness of yourself<br/>
as you have dreamt it to be -<br/>
contain, in truth, all wisdom;<br/>
that *you*<br/>
contain all perfections<br/>
holy men would so diligently seek<br/>
and ignorant men would mistakenly seek<br/>
in the destitution<br/>
of their worldly dreams.

That one true God<br/>
to whom you are eternally united,<br/>
so that no boundary between you<br/>
can be distinguished,<br/>
is that which has sustained<br/>
the infinite forms<br/>
of your dreams,<br/>
their incessant creation fueled<br/>
by the one thought of separation.

And now,<br/>
in the time of Recognition,<br/>
after the allure of the dream has paled<br/>
and finally lost all trace of significance,<br/>
and in that perfect silence<br/>
where the sleeping Son no longer rebels<br/>
against the simple<br/>
and loving<br/>
embrace of the Holy Father,<br/>
the light of the living Christ is rekindled.

As a flame in a windless place,<br/>
its light grows ever brighter,<br/>
dissolving all traces of the shadows<br/>
which have kept it hidden,<br/>
lighting up the dark places<br/>
where the dust which is the world<br/>
has settled,<br/>
until even the dust is dissolved<br/>
and becomes as Light itself.

The doer is undone.<br/>
The maker of the world is unmade,<br/>
and Christ again,<br/>
lives.

Here,<br/>
the end of all fruitless journeying.

Here,<br/>
the ceasing of all strife.

Here,<br/>
the realization of the only Truth,<br/>
beyond all utterance,<br/>
beyond the understanding of the world,<br/>
beyond even the dream<br/>
of the one who would seek God.

For the seeker is no more,<br/>
as if he had never been,<br/>
save as a fading memory of a dream<br/>
dreamt long ago.

Returned to the embrace<br/>
of our Holy Father,<br/>
the one who has returned acknowledges:<br/>
“I AM that One.”

*Christ lives, and Christ alone.*

As it is,<br/>
has been,<br/>
and forever shall be.

The awakened Heart<br/>
is likened unto one<br/>
who has journeyed<br/>
to the summit<br/>
of the highest mountain.

Here,<br/>
she looks out upon<br/>
the distances traveled,<br/>
the many landscapes<br/>
stretching out below her,<br/>
the seemingly infinite shapes and hues.

She beholds all the worlds of mankind,<br/>
and sees them as empty,<br/>
as a moment’s diversion,<br/>
fragments of but one dream.

She beholds herself as the one dreamer,<br/>
and she would that<br/>
every vestige of herself<br/>
be nudged from sleep to waking.

And now,<br/>
the transformation is completed.

Resting in the Light of Remembrance,<br/>
embraced eternally<br/>
in the arms of his Father,<br/>
the only begotten Son abides<br/>
in the Kingdom<br/>
prepared for him<br/>
in that most ancient<br/>
beginning before time is.

Her will has become<br/>
as her Father’s.<br/>
United again as one,<br/>
the first movement of that Divine Will<br/>
stirs in the vision before her.

Compassion arises<br/>
for the whole of Creation<br/>
and she sees without effort<br/>
the task set before her:<br/>
the awakening of the whole of herself,<br/>
now recognized as every soul,<br/>
every blade of grass,<br/>
every wisp of breeze.

Awakened<br/>
as the source of all things,<br/>
existing in all things,<br/>
the one Son,<br/>
united with the Holy Father -<br/>
the brief dream of the Prodigal Son<br/>
vanquished -<br/>
looks out upon himself<br/>
with but one desire: Awaken!

Restored to her rightful place<br/>
at the right hand of the Holy Father,<br/>
purified of all distortions<br/>
born of a moment’s dream, <br/>
a movement begins.

Felt in the heart,<br/>
it expands first upward,<br/>
upward beyond the crown of the head,<br/>
then outward,<br/>
filling every cell<br/>
of a body transfigured,<br/>
brought evermore<br/>
to the form of a vehicle<br/>
that will serve only the fulfillment<br/>
of her task.

And then,<br/>
when the Father and the Son together<br/>
have prepared<br/>
the body and mind of Christ,<br/>
the movement of Divine Will<br/>
becomes *downward*,<br/>
compelling the arisen Christ to step<br/>
deliberately and without haste<br/>
in the direction of all that now lies<br/>
before Him,<br/>
far below Him,<br/>
spread as far as the eye can see,<br/>
slumbering at the base<br/>
of this great Mount Zion.

Now,<br/>
her steps<br/>
become more certain.

Now,<br/>
his steps<br/>
become ever lighter,<br/>
unburdened from the weight<br/>
of a self that never was,<br/>
yet clamored for a food<br/>
which never satisfied.

Now,<br/>
her steps<br/>
become ever more directed<br/>
from a source perfectly trusted,<br/>
and with each step,<br/>
dissolving<br/>
is any need to know<br/>
where she goes,<br/>
what she shall eat,<br/>
or what she shall wear,<br/>
for her Father knows<br/>
she has need of these things.

He knows but one thing only:<br/>
he goes as the wind,<br/>
caring not the direction of his travels,<br/>
remembering not<br/>
the direction of his coming,<br/>
abiding always<br/>
in the Light of the Holy Father.

Behold!<br/>
The servant is born.

<p markdown="1" class="center">*For the first shall be last,<br/>
and the last, first.*</p>
{: .omit}

The only begotten Son dreams.<br/>
And in his dream is forgotten<br/>
that which eternally<br/>
he *is*.

And the first has become last,<br/>
even as the creation<br/>
of innumerable worlds arises,<br/>
replacing the splendor<br/>
of Remembrance<br/>
with the lifeless,<br/>
enchanting,<br/>
ever-changing forms of mere illusions.

And the last has become as the first.

Yet,<br/>
within the worlds<br/>
of her dream<br/>
lies the crystal clear gem<br/>
of Reality,<br/>
for the unspeakable Love<br/>
which the Father is<br/>
illuminates the dream of the Son,<br/>
granting her perception<br/>
of all that she would *choose* to perceive.

And the Father merely waits,<br/>
abiding wholly in the purity of his Light,<br/>
seeing naught but the splendor<br/>
of his Son,<br/>
waiting for the one who lays dreaming<br/>
to awaken.

The first is, indeed,<br/>
now last,<br/>
and what must always be last -<br/>
mere illusions cast by,<br/>
and within,<br/>
the mind of the Son -<br/>
has become first:<br/>
the Kingdom is forgotten.

Habituated<br/>
to the play of shadows,<br/>
no more than projections<br/>
of his momentary thought,<br/>
the Son suffers the worlds<br/>
of his own making,<br/>
reveling in transitory pleasures,<br/>
enduring the pain of countless wounds;<br/>
yet he continues on,<br/>
proliferating the worlds of experience,<br/>
seeking ever more desperately<br/>
for what he has long forgotten,<br/>
knowing not what it is he seeks,<br/>
calling it by various names,<br/>
striving endlessly<br/>
to discover his salvation<br/>
in the worlds he has made,<br/>
insisting it be found there.

And the Father waits,<br/>
abiding in the purity of his Light,<br/>
seeing naught but the radiant splendor<br/>
of his Son.

The maker of the world,<br/>
but not of Reality,<br/>
unknowingly remains impelled<br/>
to experience again and yet again<br/>
the fruit of pride:<br/>
vanity of vanities.

Insisting on her chosen thought,<br/>
enmeshed<br/>
in a deepening web of shadow,<br/>
yet she cries out desperately<br/>
in the aloneness of her soul:

*“__I__ am,<br/>
__I__ create,<br/>
__My__ will be done!”*

And still,<br/>
the Father waits,<br/>
abiding in the purity of his Light,<br/>
seeing naught but the radiant splendor<br/>
of his beloved Son.

As the offspring of Light Divine<br/>
wanders from world to world,<br/>
ceaselessly moved to act,<br/>
seeking<br/>
without knowing he seeks,<br/>
searching for the Kingdom<br/>
without knowing he searches,<br/>
creating and devouring the forms<br/>
of his apparently endless dream,<br/>
an impulse begins to grow.

At first unnoticed,<br/>
soft,<br/>
and seemingly far away,<br/>
overwhelmed by the noise and conflicts<br/>
of his making,<br/>
it grows.

Through endless circles<br/>
and a myriad of landscapes,<br/>
ceaselessly<br/>
through agonies and ecstasies<br/>
disguised in infinite masks,<br/>
it grows,<br/>
becoming as a Voice<br/>
whispering beyond the threshold<br/>
of his hearing,<br/>
whispering a song<br/>
forever eternal,<br/>
forever untouched by a single jot or tittle<br/>
of all that the Son experiences.

It is a song<br/>
of Truth beyond all doubt,<br/>
a song<br/>
of Reality uncompromised,<br/>
a song<br/>
which sings of the imperishable essence,<br/>
the very essence of his being,<br/>
a song which is<br/>
the Love of the Holy Father.

Though the Voice sings the song<br/>
without ceasing,<br/>
the Son hears not,<br/>
her ears turned not<br/>
to the Voice whose song<br/>
is like one crying in the wilderness,<br/>
but to the din<br/>
of ephemeral shadows<br/>
cast upon the walls of her prison,<br/>
recognizing not the Light<br/>
which lights all darkness,<br/>
believing still that darkness to be<br/>
the Light she would seek,<br/>
the Light that will illuminate her way,<br/>
and reveal the treasure<br/>
she believes resides there.

And still,<br/>
the Father waits,<br/>
abiding in the purity of his Light,<br/>
seeing naught but the radiant splendor<br/>
of his only begotten,<br/>
his beloved,<br/>
his Son,<br/>
eternal.

Still,<br/>
the Son travels.<br/>
Through valleys<br/>
of the shadow of death,<br/>
climbing mountains<br/>
made of the stones of uncertainties,<br/>
fording rivers whose far shores<br/>
often cannot be seen,<br/>
rivers wild with the tumult of emotions<br/>
arising like angry waves<br/>
from depths already seething<br/>
in memories<br/>
clutched tightly in the grasp<br/>
of the one who believes in shadow<br/>
and worships it,<br/>
knowing not that he does so.

And still, the Father waits,<br/>
abiding always in the purity of his Light,<br/>
rejoicing in the perfection of his Son,<br/>
waiting for the child<br/>
to make but one simple,<br/>
quiet choice:<br/>
to awaken!

As she travels on,<br/>
there comes now a moment here,<br/>
and again there,<br/>
moments sadly fleeting,<br/>
yet filled with the clarity<br/>
of the song that calls unto her.

Were she to turn but for an instant<br/>
and embrace what the moment would offer,<br/>
*the journey would be no more*,<br/>
the simple choice recognized,<br/>
and made.

It is but his weariness<br/>
that forces him to pause,<br/>
to rest in that silence<br/>
which is the doorway to his Heart,<br/>
where alone fulfillment resides.

The treasure rests<br/>
in the palm of her hand,<br/>
yet she comprehends it not.

Habituated only<br/>
to the grasping of illusion,<br/>
she has not the capacity<br/>
to recognize what has touched her:<br/>
the Light of the Father<br/>
that would loosen the knot<br/>
binding her to enchantment<br/>
with unceasing emptiness.

Believing himself restored,<br/>
and himself the restorer,<br/>
he plunges headlong once again,<br/>
going on,<br/>
going-where?

He mistakes his endless circling<br/>
for clear direction to the finality<br/>
*he* would make,<br/>
failing to see he travels<br/>
but the same valleys,<br/>
the same mountains,<br/>
the same rivers.

Cleverly cloaking these<br/>
with her own shifting perceptions,<br/>
she beguiles herself into believing<br/>
not that she sees differently,<br/>
but that what she sees<br/>
*is* different and new.

And yet the Father waits,<br/>
ever so patient<br/>
with his beloved Son,<br/>
abiding eternally in the knowledge<br/>
beyond comprehension,<br/>
that the dream his Son would dream<br/>
in truth, exists not;<br/>
rejoicing without ceasing<br/>
in the radiance of his holy child,<br/>
untouched eternally<br/>
by the illusion of sin.

A deepening weariness grows<br/>
in the heart of the dreamer,<br/>
a weariness<br/>
neither understood<br/>
nor recognized<br/>
by the mind accustomed to shadows,<br/>
nor a body blind<br/>
to the seed of Light within it.

The dreamer moves on,<br/>
yet the weariness remains within him,<br/>
unvanquished by his fruitless pause,<br/>
restored not by his habitual escape<br/>
from shadows.

Disconcerted,<br/>
she moves along familiar byways,<br/>
increasingly unable to blot out<br/>
this persistent<br/>
though subtle<br/>
weariness,<br/>
an ache that remains with her,<br/>
no matter the form<br/>
or intensity<br/>
of her efforts to be free of it.

And now,<br/>
fear arises.<br/>
It is a fear unlike<br/>
any he has experienced<br/>
within his countless journeys<br/>
in the fields of illusions.

Not a fear<br/>
from which he can hide,<br/>
nor a fear<br/>
he can successfully suppress<br/>
by heaping upon it<br/>
the weight of evermore enchantments.

It is a fear<br/>
to which she is unaccustomed,<br/>
for it stems not<br/>
from her experience of the world,<br/>
but grows quietly from<br/>
and remains present within<br/>
the core of her being.

Intensifying his efforts<br/>
to find solace in the changing landscapes<br/>
of his dreams<br/>
serves only to confirm<br/>
the reality of his fear.

Unlike anything<br/>
she has yet encountered,<br/>
this fear becomes a constant<br/>
though unwelcome<br/>
companion.

It becomes as a child<br/>
who increasingly refuses to be ignored,<br/>
and the dreamer of a thousand worlds,<br/>
proud author<br/>
of a multitude of illusions,<br/>
survivor of numerous heavens and hells,<br/>
trembles.

In his trembling,<br/>
he does not pause in his vain pursuits<br/>
as much as he is *made* to stop,<br/>
and looking at<br/>
what he would resist seeing,<br/>
he beholds:<br/>
The salt of the world<br/>
has begun to lose its savor.

Weariness<br/>
perceived as fear<br/>
appears to her as an unknown force<br/>
from which she cannot hide,<br/>
yet cannot embrace.<br/>
It seems to run before her<br/>
as she scampers first up one hill,<br/>
greeting her face-to-face at the summit,<br/>
and fording rivers<br/>
swum countless times before,<br/>
she emerges only to find it<br/>
waiting on the far shore.

Beginning to sense<br/>
that this unknown force<br/>
is not to be cast aside,<br/>
the dreamer laments within himself,<br/>
and in the midst of all his doing,<br/>
the faint echo of a sound<br/>
he has forever dreaded<br/>
is heard.

The doer of all deeds is shaken,<br/>
the foundation of his creations<br/>
wobbles and weakens;<br/>
he beholds the force within himself<br/>
and,<br/>
for the first time,<br/>
acknowledges his impending death.

Though she acts within her worlds,<br/>
striving to continue<br/>
in the only way she knows,<br/>
seeking fervently<br/>
to return and remain<br/>
in familiar terrain,<br/>
the forms of her dream<br/>
hold not their enticing allure,<br/>
and her efforts to remain<br/>
in all that she knows<br/>
provide no satisfaction.

Her thirst is not fulfilled,<br/>
and even her sleep is troubled.

The dreamer,<br/>
saddened by the growing loss of luster<br/>
beheld in his dreams,<br/>
becomes as one who grasps at mirages,<br/>
finding naught but emptiness<br/>
in his hands,<br/>
yet continues to grasp<br/>
because it is all he knows to do.

She waits for a death<br/>
she is sure will come,<br/>
both loathing it<br/>
and secretly longing for it.<br/>
She is defeated<br/>
but knows not how,<br/>
nor by what.

The dreams,<br/>
that throughout countless lifetimes<br/>
had fed him with the promise<br/>
of fulfillment,<br/>
wither,<br/>
like parched leaves clinging to branches<br/>
whose source of water<br/>
is mysteriously severed from unseen roots,<br/>
while the power of his life<br/>
drains from his limbs.

The proud dreamer<br/>
has not the energy to dream,<br/>
and believes beyond question<br/>
that where there are not dreams,<br/>
there is not Life,<br/>
and the growing emptiness<br/>
is as a torment to him.

She raises her head only occasionally,<br/>
and feebly,<br/>
hoping to the end to see in her dreams<br/>
the Life she had always sought there.

Finally,<br/>
wearied to the bone<br/>
of fighting what he senses<br/>
but cannot see,<br/>
of what he feels<br/>
but cannot grasp,<br/>
the dreamer releases not only<br/>
the last vestige of his will to dream,<br/>
but lays down<br/>
even the dream of the dreamer,<br/>
and dissolves into what he knows<br/>
must certainly be<br/>
his final, and consummate,<br/>
death.

{: .omit}

And now,<br/>
the dreamer is laid to rest.

It is a rest<br/>
from which there can be<br/>
no hope of arising.

Unlike the many pauses<br/>
in which the maker of all worlds<br/>
merely retreated to gain strength<br/>
for his journeys,<br/>
this rest<br/>
transcends the world.<br/>
It transcends the body,<br/>
the mind,<br/>
and all the dreamer<br/>
had thought himself to be.

It is a rest<br/>
in which even the soul reclines,<br/>
turned away<br/>
from all enchantments,<br/>
dissolved in the Mystery of all mysteries,<br/>
beyond the pale of words,<br/>
beyond all imagined things.

Verily,<br/>
the dreamer<br/>
is no more to be found.<br/>
Vanished without a trace,<br/>
not only of her ending,<br/>
*but of her beginning;*<br/>
the journey which *seemed* to be,<br/>
is *not*.

And the last,<br/>
made to be first,<br/>
is again become last.

Not by a force which comes<br/>
from outside the dreamer,<br/>
but a force which already abides<br/>
in the very seed<br/>
of the dreamer’s beginning;<br/>
the certainty of his death<br/>
is present in his birth<br/>
and must inevitably flower,<br/>
its petals blotting out<br/>
the very dream of the dreamer itself.

Yet what is perceived<br/>
by the dreamer<br/>
as the darkness of certain death,<br/>
the giving up of all hope for salvation<br/>
in the things of the worlds<br/>
she has conjured into being,<br/>
is not darkness,<br/>
but Light.

It is that Light which lights all things,<br/>
the echo of an endless song<br/>
coming as a thief in the night,<br/>
the eternal voice of our Holy Father.

And the Voice<br/>
has overcome<br/>
the shouting of the world,<br/>
restoring the Son<br/>
to a rest true and deep,<br/>
a rest which alone can heal and transform<br/>
the heart of his holy Son.

The one who would be<br/>
the dreamer of all worlds rests,<br/>
unseen by a world<br/>
unaware of what occurs in its midst,<br/>
all boundaries<br/>
that have defined her form<br/>
dissolved in incomprehensible Light.

The Son abides<br/>
in the rest of perfect Grace.

What was last<br/>
and made first<br/>
is again made last.

And all the heavens rejoice<br/>
beyond the capacity of the world<br/>
to hear.

And now is the world,<br/>
entranced by the power of its dreams,<br/>
lifted gently toward<br/>
the open arms of God.

At the end of a holy instant,<br/>
incapable of measurement<br/>
by a world imprisoned in time,<br/>
the rest of the only begotten<br/>
Son of God<br/>
gives rise to a movement<br/>
not born of a mind<br/>
bound to the illusion of separation,<br/>
but of the eternal Heart<br/>
of the arisen Christ,<br/>
a movement that would take him<br/>
not back into the dream of the world,<br/>
but ever deeper<br/>
into the Reality of his being:<br/>
a journey *within* the Kingdom of Heaven.

Awakened,<br/>
the mind free<br/>
from the shackles of want,<br/>
the body free<br/>
from useless demands<br/>
made by a self that never was,<br/>
a heart beating only<br/>
by the breath of the Most High,<br/>
the arisen Christ moves<br/>
where once the world arose,<br/>
seeing naught but the glory<br/>
of his Father’s Kingdom:<br/>
radiance beyond description,<br/>
joy without boundary,<br/>
purpose in which<br/>
fulfillment is certain.

Here,<br/>
no trace of effort<br/>
is to be found.

Here,<br/>
no taint of striving<br/>
clouds his perception.

Here,<br/>
no constriction of the heart<br/>
by the grand illusion of fear<br/>
is felt.

Reduced to simplicity,<br/>
exalted above all things,<br/>
the one transformed<br/>
by the miracle of Grace<br/>
lives and walks.<br/>
Behold!<br/>
The dreamer,<br/>
now transformed,<br/>
is reborn as the one<br/>
through whom the Father alone<br/>
works to transfigure the world.

For darkness shall become as Light,<br/>
extended without end<br/>
until Creation itself is no more.

Indeed,<br/>
the first is again, first.

As it was in the beginning,<br/>
is now,<br/>
and forever shall be.

The Prodigal Son<br/>
is returned,<br/>
and all of Heaven is shaken<br/>
by the praise of the Heavenly Host;<br/>
the Father and the Son<br/>
rest together as one<br/>
in that peace which forever passes<br/>
all understanding.

To any among you<br/>
who has ears to hear,<br/>
*let her hear*.

And all things *are* made new.
