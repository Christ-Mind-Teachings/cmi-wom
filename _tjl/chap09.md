<span class="capital">“T</span>here. It’s finished.” I mutter under my
breath, as I save the draft for *The Jeshua Letters* in a file, some
part of me hopes it disappears into the strange black hole of
cyberspace, that cosmic junkyard where the Gods of Computerland eat up
everything not backed up or printed out!  If this book could be so
eaten, just maybe that part of me could rest as it gradually resumed
authority and control over my life.

I am startled at the chuckle that comes as the thought ends. It
surprises me because it has emerged from a place much deeper than where
my ego lives, as though I just discovered a room in my house I didn’t
know even existed.

As I push back from my keyboard, I notice for the first time that it is
dark, and a glance at the clock reveals it is eleven pm. I realize I’ve
been living in a very different world for the last seven weeks. I even
missed Christmas, though I must say I can’t even remember thinking about
it!

The writing has meant a deep immersion in all that Jeshua has shared
with me, and I have been occasionally surprised when a strong feeling
would come over me leading to the removal of copious amounts of
material. At times I have heard Him say, “not yet”. Was it the personal
information about His life? The controversial matter of the ‘End Times’?
The visions He has shown me about what this Work is to be in the future?

There is no rational explanation for this, only a deep inner sense of
rightness, and I trust that completely…I think!

Some things He has said recently keep stirring within me:

<div data-index="1" markdown="1" class="indent">
Choose then, only to release your useless dream, and<br/>
be born again into the experience of the Kingdom.<br/>
This choice gives birth to a process of recognition that<br/>
quickly reestablishes remembrance of the Son’s<br/>
rightful place.

</div>

That shoots a hole in what I now see has been the entire thrust of my
‘spiritual path’ since 1973, when I took up meditation and yoga, along
with study of the world’s religions and psychologies. I see now, with
extraordinary clarity, that all of it was based on a ‘me’ striving to
attain, to gain a knowledge and (I humbly admit) a control over my life.
Now it all appears in this new light as simply a dream, based on a false
premise: I have looked the enemy in the face and seen it is but a ‘me’
that is little more than a habit cultivated since the choice was made to
exist in the Dream of Separation!

After all these years, I feel like I have only truly just begun. What is
it He alludes to as this mysterious ‘process of recognition’? Do I get
to peek around the corner to see if it is safe?

Now, that thought brings an outright laugh; what a hoot! Who could be
asking such questions if not that smaller part of me that is the habit
of separation - rooted in fear - I once fully identified as my self?

How can I ever hope to discover what this mystery means, unless I fully
submit to the way of love Jeshua reveals, and to which he has called us?

I rise from my chair, and shake off the stiffness in my legs as I roam
to the kitchen for a cup of tea. While the water races to boiling, I
break off mint leaves and breathe in their scent. I drop the leaves into
the pot, and watch them as they are rolled and tossed in the water. A
part of me senses that I am not unlike those mint leaves, plopped into
waters I had heretofore been ignorant existed, while claiming all sorts
of ‘knowledge’ about those very waters.

I feel embarrassed. I feel reduced to being not unlike a marriage
counselor who has never been married, or a UFO expert who has never seen
one...ugh!

Returning to my desk, I realize I was wrong. It’s not finished, yet.
This manuscript isn’t finished, and I most certainly am not. I can feel
it: this old nemesis that has lived so long and so deeply within me.
This nemesis emerging from within the shadows of my own existence so
clearly I am startled - no, shocked - that I could have looked past it
in avoidance for so long. This nemesis has a name, and it is ‘Fear’. I
don’t mean the kind of fear I felt in Vietnam, or at plenty of other
moments. This is something else, something deeper. Something in the
fabric of my very soul, if that makes any sense.

My body shudders suddenly. For it is clear to me that the only way to be
free of this nemesis will somehow require that I be lived into Reality.
What’s more, radically so, is that this is actually God ‘taking the
final step for me’! Whoa! Where is there hope for any modicum of control
in that?! Yet, He promises the result will be to arrive in a new land, a
land that is the opposite of fear: Love.

Love. Sweet, sweet love! I thought I knew something about it, but now as
I sip this delicious mint tea and hear the nearly freezing rain begin to
pelt my window, I must accept I have known little - if anything - of its
true nature. The love Jeshua speaks of certainly cannot have anything to
do with what I deem pleases me, since that ‘me’ has been steeped in the
soup of ego. I feel reduced, yet again, to being a mere child, a child
with much to learn.

And what about His cryptic statement:

<div markdown="1" class="indent">
Soon, there comes a clear sign unto you of the Work<br/>
in which you participate, the Work of the Son’s<br/>
atonement. When you clearly choose the active<br/>
participation in this Work, there will be nothing<br/>
which will not be provided.

</div>

A clear sign! Yahoo! I could use some of those! Or, again, are they
needed only by that now smaller part of me so used to fearful
apprehension often hidden behind a smile?

I pull up the file again and find myself drawn to words I know I feel a
deep resistance to:

<div data-index="1" markdown="1" class="indent">
There is no effort experienced in the Kingdom. There<br/>
is only a manifestation of the Father’s will through<br/>
you; a demonstration that touches the sleeping Son<br/>
cloaked momentarily in a dream of aloneness.

</div>

I flip through the printed pages of His recent communications, my eyes
stopping on one more strange statement:

<p class="center">The completion of this project is inevitable now.</p>

“Right!” I suddenly shout. “What the hell do I know about writing a
book, much less getting it published! And who the f--- would read this
crap anyway, and why would they want to? Now, this thing actually
becoming a book people read. Now, that would be a ‘clear sign’, ha!”

Really, I am screaming these thoughts, as though attempting to rebuff
some unseen advancing army trying to storm my castle! My body shudders
again. Not once, but twice. Three times, actually. What the heck is He
talking about? That nemesis I thought I had buried deep enough to be rid
of - like a cancer under control - is suddenly and literally kicking and
screaming:

“No! Not me! I’m not worthy! Look at me! Look at my utter failures! I
mean, I’m really the worst of the worse! There’s nothing that could be
possibly manifest through me of any value at all, nothing!”

That final word explodes from the realm of thought, and a body shaking
and trembling, into a loud, defiant scream that shakes me to the core.

I give up fighting it, all of it. If ‘allowing’ is the key to the
Kingdom, then I may as well start with this sudden gushing of tears from
a well deep within my heart and belly. The strength goes from my legs,
and I collapse onto the floor. The tears - interspersed with a litany of
self-loathing arguments - increase their flow. Yet the floor is
comforting somehow. I surrender into this darkness, rather than fighting
it. And touch for a moment, even as the flow continues, a hint of peace,
of real peace.

The early morning clanging of garbage cans wakens me. I don’t know when
I fell asleep, or whether the tears stopped before sleep, or because of
it. Rising, I peer out of the icy windows to watch the garbage
collectors do their important - and underrated - job.

What would they do if this was happening to them? What would anyone do?
All of a sudden, an idea crashes head first into my whole being:

“I’m getting out of this cold, dark, dreary place. I’m gonna go to
Hawaii again!”

Energy is surging through me as I pull out my suitcase from the closet.

“What, Marc, no careful planning?” My, things are changing!

The thought occurs to me to print out the draft of *The Jeshua Letters*. I
see myself, as though in a movie, delivering it to Kendra on the way to
the airport.

A week later, I am walking up the steps to her door, manuscript tucked
under my arm.
