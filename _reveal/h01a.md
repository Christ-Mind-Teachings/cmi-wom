## The Way of Mastery

* Given by Jeshua, the historical Jesus
* A series of monthly channeled lessons (and more)
* Packed with meaning, no hyperbole, no meaningless words
* From out of this world - literally

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">

* First contacted Jayem July 1987
* WOH: 1994
* He's so much more than the Jesus the world knows.
* It is the message of Christ Mind.
* There are many expressions (channels) of this message
* Jeshua coming through 2003 others
* Paul Tuttle: 1982, Jayem: 1987, Judith Coates: 1993
* It is practical, down to earth, and to the point.
* Expect it to be different from everything you've been taught before.
* It can be trusted implicitly.
* Jeshua or Jesus: I don't care what you call me just don't call me late for dinner.

Then the soul begins to turn from the things of this created world, it

* He speaks to us as the soul, not the separated self we think we are
Kingdom
* We don't need to search for truth, that doesn't work. We just need to

can't help but fall on your knees in praise of yourself.

### From Judas 

Love is the backdrop, the eternal infinite power of potential from which we can create.
There is no limit on what we can create. That is the power of Love that holds us. We are vast
beyond measure and in that we can create infinitely, yet the backdrop remains. That backdrop
is a Love that allows, trusts, and holds all things.
{: .smaller}

All that is desired to be experienced, whether it is experienced as love or evil, it is all
a matter of choice. The desire flowing into a choice for what do I truly want to experience.

<section markdown="1" data-menu-title="Pathway Description">
### What is the Way of the Heart

> That pathway that cultivates within you the decision to turn your attention upon your own mind,
> upon your own behavior, upon what is true and real for you, moment to moment. To study it, to
> consider it, to feel it, to breathe the Light of Spirit through it, and to constantly retrain

### Why is This Necessary?

Without it there can be no <span class="uline">peace</span> and you cannot
transcend the false identifications that you have choosen.

You need to come to the point where you say to yourself,
{: .smaller.alignleft}

<section markdown="1" data-menu-title="What it Is">
### The Way of the Heart 

* The way unknown to the world
* Unknown to many who would call themselves Spiritual Teachers
* The way that was taught to Jeshua
* Brings about the reversal of every thought you have ever had about any one or any thing
* That way alone where you come to rest in the Perfect Peace from which you have sprung forth
* Pathway of truthfulness
* A way of releasing every hope and wish to be special
* Cultivate the art of the simplicity of empty-headedness and not-knowingness
* Where all things and all events become aspects of your meditation and prayer

<section markdown="1" data-menu-title="The Goal">
### The Goal

To establish, once again within you, the Truth that is true always:
{: .alignleft.smaller}

> Not my will, but Thine be done. For of myself, I do nothing. But my Father does all things
> through me.

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">

<section markdown="1" data-menu-title="The Heart">
### The Way of the <span class="uline">Heart</span>, not the Intellect

> The Heart is that which feels all things, embraces all things, trusts all
> things, allows all things. The Heart is that in which the soul rests eternally.
> The Heart is that which is beyond space and time and is that spark of Light in
> the Mind of God, which is called Christ. And only in That will you find the
> peace that you seek.

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
* This is an expression of Unity - not separation
* Nothing rejected, nothing resisted, all embraced
* This is the same description given of Consciousness
* And the Heart is equated with Christ
* Later Love is described in the very same way
* They are all one, The Heart, Christ, Consciousness, Love
</aside>
</section>
<section markdown="1" data-menu-title="The Intellect">
### The Intellect

* The intellect was never designed to be your master. It was designed to be the
humble, and very stupid servant of the Awakened Heart.
* The intellect does not know anything except the trivialities that you have
shoved into it, like garbage into a garbage can. 
* The intellect can never bring the healing of the Heart that is the Atonement.
  It can only be utilized to argue against the insane perceptions you are used
  to, so that you might come to see that perhaps there is a greater good in
  giving up your insistence on treating the intellect as your god.

<section markdown="1" data-menu-title="Imagine">
### Imagine

Imagine a state of being in which you walk through the world looking like
everyone else and yet you are spacious within, you are empty within.
{: .alignleft.smaller}

You desire nothing though you allow desire to move through you and recognize
it as the Voice of the Father guiding your personality, emotions and even
the body, to the experiences through which the tapestry of the Atonement is
being woven.
{: .alignleft.smaller}

And you trust the complete flow of that.
{: .alignleft.smaller}

> For in Truth, that mind that trusts the Source of its creation allows
> all things, trusts all things, embraces all things, and transcends all things.

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
* This is an example of the awakened state - very practical and down to earth
* This is describing complete acceptance of the world as it is
* Which is to transcend every judgment and defense through our trust in God
* This is the first hint at Axiom 4
</aside>
</section>

<section markdown="1" data-menu-title="Only God's Plan Will Work">
### Only God's Plan Will Work

Whenever you feel frustration and anxiety, it is because you have decided
not to trust the Truth. And the Truth is this:
{: .alignleft.smaller}

> Only God's plan for salvation can work for you. Your way must always
> fail, for your way begins with the illusory and insane assumption that
> you are a separate being from the Mind of God and must, therefore, direct
> your own course.

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
* We've been trying our own way for a long time and it doesn't work.
* This is why 'Allowance' is such an important teaching in WOM

<section markdown="1" data-menu-title="Great Humility">
### Humility

It requires great humility to accept the <span class="uline">first step of the path</span>:
{: .alignleft.smaller}

> I have done all this; I must undo it. But I have no idea how I did this. 
> Therefore I must surrender to something else.

<aside markdown="1" class="notes">
* Great humility to accept Axiom 1
* It's a letting go of the personal self
* It is a challenge
</aside>

<section markdown="1" data-menu-title="No Ordinary Moments">
### No Ordinary Moments

> What if the very life you are living, what if
> everything was being directly sent to you of your Father, because your Father
> knows what is necessary to unravel within your consciousness to allow you to
> awaken? What if the very things you are resisting are the very stepping
> stones to your homecoming? What if you achieved a maturity along this pathway
