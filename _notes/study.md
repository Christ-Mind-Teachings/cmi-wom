Jeshua has given the following suggestions about how to
“listen” to the recordings or transcripts of these Lessons.

1. Select a separate 'Way of' notebook with a cover that has meaning
for you, and a pen that you love; use them only for this work. Keep your
notebook in a sacred space (such as on your altar, if you have one)
wherever you live.

2. Always settle down, relax and allow the breath to flow deeply and
fully before you start listening to the recordings or reading the
transcripts.

3. Allow the words to simply land within you, without any effort to
understand all of this information at once.

4. Notice which passages cause feelings to arise within your being.

5. Make selective notes and identify in your 'Way of' notebook those
passages which touch your feeling nature.

6. Later (or on a different day) copy the passages from your notebook
which elicited a strong feeling. Write them several times on a separate
sheet of paper in a state of innocence and playfulness.

7. Whenever a question is asked it is useful to pause and reflect on
it, before moving on.

These Lessons were first given with the intention of each being lived
with, and deeply absorbed, for at least thirty days. In reality you will
find that each Lesson keeps teaching you, and taking you further into
your own spiritual awakening!

Listen to each recording or read the Lesson several times in different
locations at different times of the day. Stay with each Lesson until you
feel complete with it.

Doing the exercises as given is also very important. Many of these
exercises are the same ones that were given to Jeshua by his Essene
elders over 2000 years ago.

Feel free to use these suggestions as you wish, but most of all have fun
with the material.
