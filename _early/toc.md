Now we begin. 

Greetings unto you, beloved and holy children of Light divine. In Truth it is
with great joy that I come forth to abide with you, and yet I come forth unto
you always and I abide with you always, for there is not a place nor a time
that I am not. I am but your brother and I am but your friend. I am not above
you and I am never apart from you. I am indeed the holy and only begotten Son
of God, Son meaning offspring of, and if I be this &mdash; and rest assured that I am
&mdash; then so, too, are you the offspring of Light, of Love, of what has been
called God, that which I have chosen to call "Abba" or Father. And if you are
the holy offspring of Light divine and if I am that holy offspring of Light
divine, it means that in Truth we share one Mind and one Heart, and we are
created before the foundations of all worlds. And because this is the Truth and
because it is the essence of our only reality, there cannot be a time or a
place that I am unavailable to you or to anyone. And there cannot be a time and
a place, if you would receive it, that you are not available to everyone. 

Do you come, then, to see and to understand that because we share that one Mind
and that one Heart that is the only begotten offspring of God and His only
creation, never have you been limited by space and time? You can't ignore the
grandness of your being. You can shut yourself off from it. You can look upon
only one part of it, but you can never separate yourself from all that you are
created to be. There has never in Truth been a time that any one of us has ever
been born or will ever die. 

Now, surely that sounds like madness &mdash; but it is the Truth. That which is alive
within you, that which is alive about you has been alive since before the
foundations of the world, and that which is alive about you will remain long
after this world has ceased to be. And if you would receive it as a thought to
be contemplated, as a thought, a suggestion, and even as a reality: all worlds
have arisen within you, and we share together equally in the creation of all
things that have come forth. And never, never has there been a time or place in
which separation has been the Truth. The appearances of bodies that rise in the
field of time and pass away do not limit the Truth of the reality we share. 

God is but Love and God creates only that which mirrors His/Her likeness. And
that means that regardless of any thought you have ever held about yourself or
about anyone, regardless of any perception the world has tried to teach you
about yourself and your nature, you remain perfectly complete and whole, by
grace if you will, because you are created in the likeness of God. And God is
without form, boundless, eternal. There is not a place that God begins and a
place that God ends, and you arise within that field which is Love. 

If that is true &mdash; and I assure you that it is &mdash; what then seems to separate the
mind? The perception you hold of yourself in which you would see yourself as
separate from God. In Truth, that doesn't matter. And yet, many of you know
what it means to spend hours, weeks, years, lifetimes perhaps, trying to find
that source of that feeling of separation from God, thinking that, with the
mind, "If only I can grasp it, then I might figure out and understand what the
nature of reality is all about, and then I will find joy and I will find peace
because I will have grasped some eternal piece of information about myself, and
because I have grasped it, I will have certainty." 

Just the opposite is true. And why? This is very, very important: you have
never been separate from God. If you exist in this moment, you are at one with
all that God is, now. And if you would search into some distant past to find
the cause of your feeling of separation, you are knowing, looking to the only
place it could be found: a choice, a choice held in the fullness of your being
here and now – not created in some distant past though it may appear that way,
but a choice made now. 

If you must look to the past, if you must look to the future to discover that
source of separation and overcome it, it means that the Love of God is not
present for you here, and yet there is only the Love of God. And that means
that right here in this small but beautiful home, filled with love, here in
this moment in the silence between two words that you seem to hear being
uttered through this bag of dust, right here is where you make the choice: the
choice to remember the Truth of who you are and to claim it. To allow it to be
lived through you as you. The choice to be but the presence of Love, here, now.
And if the choice is made here and now, it can be made in the next moment and
the next, and it can become an everlasting choice. The choice to be but the
presence of Love is based on the simple concept of the truth you did not
create, that you cannot tarnish or get rid of, that has been with you since
before the foundations of the world. And the Atonement &mdash; what I have called the
Atonement &mdash; is completed in you quite simply when you simply acknowledge that
"I and my Father are one."

If you don't like those words, make up some others, as long as it carries the
knowingness. For the grand source of your being which is but Love is present
with you now and will not forsake you. 

I came into this world as a man and I walked as others do, and the whole
purpose was not truly to save anyone from their sins but rather to demonstrate
that the illusion of separation from God does at no time limit the Truth of
your being, to demonstrate that death is not real and that separation in any of
its forms simply does not exist. 

I came only as a friend and as a brother. And in those days to call someone
"friend" wasn't done lightly &mdash; although it was imbued with great Light. To call
someone a friend meant that you were willing to see in them your equal. You
were willing to look past what you would call the personality. You would look
past perhaps their insane perceptions, their fearful thoughts, their hurtful
behaviors to see the great ray of Light which shines forth in the Mind of
Christ and lives within their heart, waiting to be rediscovered. To call
someone a friend meant that you were willing to commit yourself in relationship
to them eternally &mdash; not for a week, not for an hour, not for thirty&mdash;five years
of a nice marriage, but for eternity. 

And, therefore, I came forth as your friend to demonstrate to you the Truth not
only of my being but of yours. And if you would well receive it, I've never
gone anywhere. The world did not succeed in getting rid of me, and I am not
limited at any time in whom I would come and speak with. I can abide with you
at any time. You need only prepare a place for me and I will come and abide
with you. 

Now, what does that take? Well, first of all, you must go unto a high mountain
top, find a cave, place the bag of dust within it, speak to no one for at least
twenty&mdash;three years, do many complicated meditation techniques, flog the body
and never, never engage in what you call the sexual intimacy. Eat only one
grain of rice every four days and remember never to sleep. Then, if you’re very
good, I might choose to come and call you "friend." 

{Laughter.} 

Well, a lot of you have tried those things, and some of you know perfectly well
that you have had experiences that don't exist in this specific time frame in
which you've about tried all the things you could. Is that not true? 

Did it ever work? What, then, does work? What is it that takes the mind that
final step and brings it to the threshold of the Kingdom of Heaven, in which
the remembrance of your unity and the presence of God within you blossoms forth
and brings the dove of peace to descend upon your heart? What is it, then, that
opens that part of your mind to the holiness that has been placed within it by
God Him/Herself when you were created? 

The choice. The quiet and simple choice to relinquish your grip upon your
perception of yourself as a separate being. To relinquish your grip upon your
shame and your guilt and your sense of failure. Your willingness to relinquish
your grip on your perceptions of what the world is and what it is for. To throw
open the shutters of the heart and say, "Okay, all I want is the Love of God."
And indeed, the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, and with that choice
everything is made new. 

When the mind is brought to silence &mdash; not artificially, but genuinely because
you've chosen to withdraw the value you have placed upon perceptions that have
never worked &mdash; and when you rest in the quiet place of the Holy of Holies, the
quiet of the heart, there indeed I will come and abide with you as your friend
and as your brother. And, you see, I'm simply one who loves having a lot of
friends. And I spend all of my time &mdash; although I don't really have any of that
&mdash; communicating with anyone who would choose to lay aside all perceptions of
themselves and of me, and say, "My God, it just might be true that separation
doesn't exist, and that means my mind is joined with the mind of Jeshua, the
one the world has called Christ. And perhaps I can become so outrageous as to
think that, sitting right here on my couch, I can chat with him," 

That would be outrageous to some who want to believe that I am somewhere far
off and difficult to find. Where am 1? If I am not limited by space and time &mdash;
and I assure you that I am not &mdash; I am wherever you allow me to be. I am
wherever you allow me to be, and in the silence of the heart, rest assured,
there can be no barriers that could ever separate us. 

And right here on Kauai you could experience a gentle and simple union of
friendship with one that seemed to walk upon this plane two thousand years ago.
Of course. Because you are not the body and you have never been limited by it.
Right where you are, right where you sit, right now, it is the body that sits
within the field of mind. And that field is far more who you are than the body
could ever hope to be. 

Is it, then, a limitation? No. Is it something to be flogged again? No. The
body truly has but one purpose and one function: to serve as the means to
communicate unconditional love, to serve as a means to communicate the Truth.
Not through what you call the preaching, not through what you call the belief
systems, but in the simple act of looking upon your brother or sister right
where they are in that moment, wherever you are, and choosing to see and to
know the Truth that you are joined with them and your intimacy cannot be
shaken. It was created by God before the foundations of the world. And that is
why each relationship is the most precious blessing you have. Not because the
body of another might stay with you for thirty or forty or fifty years. That's
not its preciousness. Because the relationship truly occurs between minds that
choose to see from the foundation of Truth. To look into the physical eyes and
then begin to look with a deeper sight that sees the great ray of Light called
Christ that abides in the gentleness of that person's heart. To choose to look
past all of the perceptions you may have ever held and to know, to know, that
the one in front of you is your savior because they are offering you the
opportunity to extend the unconditional Love of God. 

Now, if that is true &mdash; and I assure you that it is &mdash; it means that you cannot
possibly have an ordinary moment &mdash; but you can believe you are having ordinary
moments. You can look past that moment of relationship. You can look past the
moment that's occurring right now. But right next to you, right next to you,
there is sitting your savior, and all you need do is turn your head and look
upon them and see with the eyes of love and you have remembered your Creator
and your Source and you have given to them the grandest of gifts that possibly
could be given: the gift of love that forgives all things, looks beyond all
things and recognizes only the Truth of what can be lived in and through that
friend. 

Can you feel the blessing of that? The power of that? Wherever you are, it is
never taken from you. Wherever you are in that moment, you have the greatest
blessing of life: to recognize the Truth by seeing it in the one in front of
you, even if they don't want to see it in themselves. 

That is how the threshold of the Kingdom is crossed. It will not occur fifty
years from now. It will not occur ten thousand years from now. It did not occur
for you when I made my choice. It occurs when you make yours: to sit back and
actually be willing to let go of fear and to entertain a thought that the world
might say is totally insane &mdash; entertain the thought, "Perhaps I am but Light.
Perhaps I am but the presence of Love. Perhaps I can relearn how to be only the
presence of Love no matter the circumstances that seem to arise around me.
Perhaps those circumstances are not there to punish me or to limit me, but
perhaps they are there because they need me to bring love to them, that set of
circumstances. Just perhaps, the Truth has always remained true." 

Many of you know what it means to seek God. You've done a very good job of
that. Some of you know what it means to puff yourself up with pride for all of
the techniques you've mastered on your way to God. You know what that feels
like. "Boy, that was a tough meditation technique. I'm glad I got it down. That
fast was very long and hard, but I stuck it out. I must be really moving along
my pathway to God." And then in the next moment you pick up a newspaper and you
don't like who got elected President, and that fast {clapping}, you extended
judgment and you don't even notice it. 

The end of seeking is upon us now. The end of seeking is upon us now. Now, that
which has been called the last days is indeed descending upon this plane, and
many of you have felt the acceleration that has been occurring for some time,
seemingly by quantum leaps lately. Many of you felt great stirrings to come to
this island &mdash; called an island because it's surrounded by water. It is just a
mountain rising above so it can be noticed. 

Many of you know that sense of acceleration &mdash; like you have to get to a certain
place and you know you have to be there but you don't know why. Trust that
Voice. And some of you know the pain of being confronted by the need to shift
what you call relationships or careers; all kinds of manners of forms of life.
Rest assured that there is a Guidance available to you always, and what seems
to stand between you and the enactment of it is only your fear that you have no
right to listen to the guidance of your own heart. 

How, then, to know? It is really quite simple. When you are at peace and when
you've been willing to set aside all of your own perceptions and concerns about
a situation and have asked of the one Comforter that I've sent unto you, called
the Holy Spirit, the answer will not be hidden. And when you are not attached
to the fruit of the answer given, but in faith you are willing to trust that it
comes from the peace within you, rest assured that the movement you enact in
life will always serve the highest and best for everyone &mdash; always, without
fail. 

You see, there is a part of your mind that is identical to mine. There is a
part of your mind that contains what has been called the Holy Spirit &mdash;
Wholeness, placed there by God Him/Herself as the bridge that reminds you of
your union with God. And when you rest upon that Bridge, and when you learn to
rest upon that Bridge with every breath, the guidance that He will bring you &mdash;
She will bring you, if you prefer &mdash; is always without error. It may seem
confounding to the ego, but that's not the point, and it will reveal itself as
having been without error. The whole purpose of time, the whole purpose of
time, the whole purpose of time was not to get anywhere, not to gain anything,
but to remember the Truth of what has always been: to allow that guidance that
is given to you gently to be your guide in all things. And that is how you
always know that you are doing what has been called the will of God. It is not
a stern will. It is just a gentle will that wants you to extend your love in
all of your creations so that it serves the remembrance of the union of Father
and Son in the minds of everyone that you meet. 

The end of seeking is upon us. The time of remembrance is well at hand. The
time of remembrance is well at hand, and if you choose to remember, in this
moment, you have remembered for the world. And if you choose to remember with
me in the next moment, we begin to enlighten the world. You cannot be separate
from anyone at anytime. It is impossible. And when you let Light come into your
mind, when you choose to be the one to view things differently, to trust the
flow of life, to trust the Love from which life itself arises, to acknowledge
in your own mind that you are created in Love and, therefore, Love abides with
you now, you choose to be that one. You are the one that uplifts the world and
enlightens it, and you make it easier for your brother and your sister to make
the choice with you. 

That is the great change that is descending upon this plane. There will come a
day when the age of what you might call the age of masters and messiahs and
teachers will be finished and then we can just simply play with you. We can
dance with you as equals and you will no longer put us on a pedestal above you
or apart from you. You will see that that Mind is shared equally by us. 

Would you choose in his hour to let the end of seeking be upon your own mind?
To know that you can trust that the Bridge lies within you and that when you
have a decision that must be made, turn it over. Do not cling to it. Place it
on the altar of your heart and ask the Holy Spirit to "Direct me in the way
that serves the Atonement, that serves the will of my Father, for I know not
which way to turn, but You are given unto me as my guide." And that gentle
Voice will indeed come to guide you, and great fruit will arise from the choice
that you make to follow the gentle Voice that is with you always. 

So, that's really about it. I have never come to say anything new. How could I?
The Truth has been with us and shared among us since before the foundations of
all worlds. You have not come to suffer this world. You have not come to what
you call, "work out your karma" &mdash; though you may choose to perceive it in that
way and, therefore, that is the experience you will have. You can learn through
pain or you can learn through joy. It's really up to you. And I know some of
you thought I chose to learn through pain. It was not painful. 

I have come in this hour, specifically in this hour, to share with you that
there is a grand drama, of course &mdash; and many of you are well aware of this &mdash; a
grand drama being enacted and carried out. See, if you bear with me for just a
moment, a little story. 

Once upon a time there was a grand and glorious child that played and laughed
and romped in his father’s precious kingdom, and all of the meadows of that
kingdom were given unto the child to play in, and the clouds that passed by
were so beautiful and the air was gentle upon his skin. One day the child had a
sudden thought to try something he hadn’t tried. "What would it be like if I
were to lay myself down in this meadow and sleep? I'm safe in the meadow. It
shouldn't be such a big deal. I've never needed sleep before but I’ll give it a
try." He lay down and in his sleep he thought, "What if I could dream my own
creations? Instead of just playing in my father's kingdom, I’ll dream up my
own. Let me see, if my father dreams or creates only unity and only love, if I
want to create unlike him so that it's a different kind of creation, I'll have
to create or dream up creations that are not lovely. If my father creates only
that which is unified, I will have to create that which mirrors separation. And
it's just a dream. It'll be harmless. I can wake up whenever I want." 

And so the dream began, and one holy gentle child closed his/her eyes and began
indeed to dream of creations unlike those that flow forth from the Mind of God,
Who is but Love, and there arose a thought in the midst of a dream. And at that
thought the holy child of God forgot to laugh and took it seriously. The
thought was the thought of guilt, that "I have somehow sinned against all that
Love is." And with that seriousness, a veil began to drop, well within the
dream, but taken seriously. One thought at which the holy Son of God failed to
laugh. 

And if you would receive it, that thought has been as the foundation of the
myriad worlds that have been made manifest, in which strife and suffering and
death seem to arise, in which all form of insanity that you have ever seen has
come forth. But from the very moment that that child lay down in the meadow to
dream, already the Bridge was given unto the child, placed there by God
Him/Herself, the Bridge of holiness that rests in the mind of the dreaming
child. And from the moment time began, there has been conflict. Many of you
have felt this. You know what I am talking about in your own minds: the
conflict between the part of the mind that seems doubtful, filled with fear,
perhaps a little self&mdash;loathing, and a part of you that always seems to know
what's going on. 

From that moment, from that very moment, all of the creations that have arisen
within that dream have been used by the Holy Spirit as the very means to gently
nudge the child back to wakefulness. Everything. Without fail. It means that
even this hour, somehow, something in your mind asks you to come to this home
in this hour. Can you appreciate, can you appreciate the grand complexity but
the simple power that brought all of us together for just a few hours? That's
rather incredible. 

And what is occurring is that there is an acceleration in the process of the
waking up of the child, and that waking up occurs seemingly in each individual
mind because you have believed in individual minds, and for no other reason. As
you have made your separation from God in the field of time, in the field of
the appearance of separation, so, too, is that field translated into the means
whereby the holy child of God awakens beyond the thought of separation, beyond
the thought of multiple minds, and Christ is returned to union with God. That
is what is going on in this plane. It's the only thing that's ever been going
on in this plane and it will be completed. 

Your journey, your journey to God, your journey into the simple choice that
right now you can allow the end of seeking to be upon you, your journey is
identical to everyone's journey on this plane. Not in form, but in essence.
Well, that means your journey is identical to mine. The forms, yes, have been
different. The time frame seems to be different but there is no one in this
room that has not known persecution and crucifixion. There is no one in this
room who hasn’t been laughed at and had at least metaphorical stones thrown at
you. There is no one in this room that has not had direct revelation and
communication with God. And your lives mirror one another’s as they do mine.
The choice is the same for you as it was for me: to choose to acknowledge
within yourself that you are not the worlds, that you abide in the Mind of God. 

You see, that choice, that choice is exactly the same for everyone. Everyone. 

*Do our dreams play a role in this? *

Make no division between what you call your dreams. Make no division between
what you call your dreams that occur while the body sleeps at night and that
which you perceive through the physical eyes as you walk through your day. If
you see separation, if you see creations that are born in time and fade away in
time, rest assured you behold the outcome of the dream, and your reality lies
just beyond that and yet within you. It is not with the physical eyes that you
can see the essence of what is true. It takes what is called inner sight, the
sight that comes with the flowering of the heart. 

Do your dreams help you? Of course they do. The dreams while the body sleeps
assist you. The dreams while you are what you call being awake assist you
equally. You will value what you believe is a system &mdash; you more than someone
else &mdash; but it is you that has expended the value, and if you say, "The dreams
that I have while the body sleeps are very important and I want to learn from
them," rest assured guidance will come to you in many forms. It will come in
the form of those that you would perceive as not having bodies. It will come to
you while you sleep. You will uncannily run into somebody in a store somewhere
who just happens to do that kind of work and you will feel attracted to being
with them, A certain book will come to you that seems to assist you in your
journey. 

Rest assured, all of that comes because you are the one that has chosen to
place value on that form of learning and there are many forms because nothing
can fail to awaken the holy Son of God who dwells within you – that everything
you offer to God becomes the means whereby you awaken from the dream of
separation. 

You see, I made a choice to give over the dream of death to my Father, and He
utilized it through the Holy Spirit to teach me that death is not real. It's
really all the crucifixion and resurrection was about. But that was still part
of my learning, and it is not something you have to repeat. Unless, of course,
you want to. 

Precious friend, look well then upon your dreams. Allow yourself to know what
you do know: that yes, they do reveal to you the essence of what the mind
values, what the mind holds fear about. But I would ask you to take this just
as a suggestion: allow the value that you extend to your dreams, your curiosity
about them, to be expanded so that you begin to see all of the events of your
waking day with the same curiosity, the same watchfulness, the same value.
"What does this moment teach me? How am I reacting to it? What choice must I be
making to feel what I feel now?" It's a rather good thing to do. 

Therefore, I am not minimizing the dreams that you would have while the body
sleeps. I'm just saying that they are the same. They equally reveal to you that
which can awaken you, but it is because you have cxtended that value. It's like
going into one of your&hellip; {End of tape.} 

&hellip;holds value and all during the day you use the power of the mind to decide
what you will extend your value to. What holds meaning? What is bringing the
blessing of the gift to you? And if you become too wrapped up in the red one,
you won't see the value of the blue ones and the yellow ones. And that is why I
asked you just to gently expand your willingness to realize that from the
moment you awaken in the morning until the moment you awaken in the next
morning, every little experience brings a blessing for you. Everything. 

Is it all a dream? Yes. Does that make it not worthwhile? No. Does it mean that
you just say, "Well, it's just a dream and therefore I’ll ignore how I'm
feeling about this or that"? No, not at all. Look at it as a dream that brings
a blessing that helps you to awaken from the dream. And when you can embrace
every moment of your dreams and extend your forgiveness and love to them, and
when you can feel safe in looking upon all things that your dreams mirror back
to you, very gently you will begin to transcend whatever limits they seem to
have brought to you. Fear will abate and you will take that step into the
presence of peace, and that peace will come to your dreams. It will come to the
cells of the body. It will come to the mind. And in the midst of all activities
you will be simply the presence of one who is awake. 

Look lovingly, precious friend, upon all of your dream. Embrace it and give
thanks for it because it is your way home. Does that help? 

*Yes. Yes, it does.* 

Happy dreams. 

*Thank you.* 

Is all of this making sense to you? 

Now, part of the dream, the process of this child's awakening, in which he will
simply open his eyes and go, "My God, I've never left the meadow in the first
place," and his Father/Mother will smile and say, "Yes, it was just all a dream
and here you are," part of it &mdash; how to say this &mdash; within the dream and the
experience of time, there have been created in your perceptions, certain worlds
that have arisen on this plane in which the remembrance of the integration of
the mind and heart was lived. Some of you know of a certain timeframe and land
that was called Lemuria. Where we abide &mdash; and by that I mean only in the
physical sense with these little bodies &mdash; is in that area where a great
continent, a great civilization, if you will, once flourished. That which you
call the Kauai was a place within that continent that was held as very sacred,
You could say it was like a hub, and because consciousness choose this place as
a sacred land in which certain temples were built, it became imbued with a
deep, what you would call, spirituality. And many of you know that even the
insanity of your modern world has never quite snuffed it out and many of you in
this room have felt called… let's not call it called; let's say, pulled in the
heart, to be here. Is that not true? As if you couldn't resist it if you wanted
to. It is because it is familiar to you, and in your own dreams and in your own
journeys, you have known this place before. 

And what is occurring now is that there is a call. A cosmic Western Union
person has sent out the telegram and said, "Hey, you were there once before.
Why don't you come back? We could use you." And there is indeed, in the initial
stages of it, a calling back together of those that share a like vision, share
a like mind and like heart and share a certain history. And you all know that
you know you recognize your own. Isn't that true? 

A feeling of familiarity with someone whose name you don't even know yet? And
when you begin to talk to each other, you realize, "Yes, my God, yes, I felt
called here." "Well, me, too." And there's just a sense of connection. Those
numbers are going to grow, and there are many that will come from what you call
the far reaches of this planet, many different countries, and you will
recognize them. 

For in part of the dream, those places, if you will, that have represented a
time of perfect peace and perfect union will again begin to be restored. Why?
Because it then creates the mirror that shows the mind of humanity the Truth.
The mirror is being recreated, and what you call Kauai has a very important
role to play in that. 

Part of that which was called the wind that just blew was part of the process
of clearing out what I believe some of you would call the auric field, the
consciousness of this island, to make room for some change. And so, of course,
the first thing you must all do is quit whatever you are doing and get a
government job, create your own political party, set your own agendas, take
control. 

{Laughter.} 

It's never worked before. All that it requires is exactly what I have sought to
share with you: the willingness to trust the guidance that speaks gently in the
quiet of your heart. Look around you in this moment, and those of you that feel
and know the depth of what I am sharing with you in these moments, look around
you because many of your brothers and sisters are with you even now. 

Why not get to know each other? Why not begin to expand what you call the
celebrations that occasionally go on here in small pockets and begin to help
others transcend what appear to be the limits of group affiliation and begin to
let your numbers join in the swell, so that you celebrate together on a very
regular basis. And notice I didn't say anything about getting together and
discussing what's wrong. Getting together to celebrate, to celebrate the Light
and the Love and the peace that Christ is, and that golden Light that descends
like a dove upon this plane, touching any mind and any heart that would but
welcome it. And begin to put aside any perception of differences about
ideologies or ideas or beliefs &mdash; none of it gets you anywhere &mdash; but coming
together to celebrate the Truth that you share one Mind and one Heart. That
Heart is the Love of God, and that is the only thing that holds any value at
all. 

You see, by doing that you will create an energy. It will be like beginning to
turn up the rheostat, and the Light will begin to grow brighter and brighter,
and certain friends that you haven't seen for what you might call a long time
are going to be awakened in their dreams with a sudden thought, "Kauai. I can't
get Kauai out of my mind. Okay, okay. I'll go." As soon as they make that
choice, a weight is going to be lifted from them. The joy will begin to
descend, a lightness will come and many of them, even when their little
airplanes come close, when they see the mountain tops, will begin to feel that
they are coming home even if they've never physically seen the place in this
life. 

They need you to welcome them. It's not just happening here, of course. There
are many such places. For, you see, you all have what is called a lineage, a
history you've created in your dramas and in your journeys. You have created
time frames, experiences in which you've heard the Word of God in its many
different forms. You begin to create ties and you've bound yourself to other
souls. You've had many similar journeys. You've created resonances. 

And what will be occurring in the years to come is a quick acceleration of what
we will call a polarization in which minds are making choices: "Where am I
going to be and what am I going to stand for?" 

It is a time of great movement, a time of upheaval upon your plane. Remain in
your clarity and know your guidance comes to you in the quiet of your heart
where there the Holy Spirit speaks to you. And that One's guidance never errs. 

If you are here, there is a reason for it. If you are called to be here for
just a week or a month at a time, there’s a reason for it. Would you, then, do
that one thing? And if you would well receive it, this is really what I came to
deliver to you in this hour: would you be willing to create a consistent time
of celebration in which you opened your arms and your hearts and your minds and
let the Love of God pour forth through you to embrace one another and the
growing numbers of those that will come? You will see that the time of seeking
has ended and the time of celebrating the Truth is upon us, on Earth as it
already is in Heaven. 

Would you be willing to do that? 

*Yes.* 

I know it's tough duty. 

{Laughter & comments.} 

Indeed. 

You see, many have wondered&hellip; there's a little verse in what you call the
Bible, in which it is reported that I said to my friends that someone thought
should be called disciples, that unto them it was given to know the secrets of
the Kingdom of Heaven. To those that are without, it is given in parables so
that hearing they might not hear and in seeing they might not see. 

You think about it. How could such talk come from the mind of one who is
supposedly awake and embraces his brother and sister as himself? Indeed, I said
that unto you it is given to know the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. I never
said that there was anyone on the outside. 

It does make sense, doesn't it? 

There are those that choose not to hear. And indeed they will because the end
of the journey is certain. The weight of separation finally becomes too much
weight to bear for every soul. Some of you know what that weight feels like,
and it's time to release it. 

Rest assured that if you are here but for the first time witnessing such a
bizarre display, it is not by accident, because a part of you has cried out to
awaken and to heal and to come back into integration and balance. And with that
call that has come from the depth of your soul, you have been guided. And you
will be guided always. 

Though you see it not, when the soul first cries out, "Enough. Show me the way.
Where is Truth? I relinquish my grip," {clapping hands} just like that, the
Holy Spirit wakes up and says, "Well, it's about time. Now, make a left&mdash;hand
turn. Now, go right. Pause. Go talk to that person over there." And you
suddenly find yourself feeling like you just can’t constrain yourself. You just
have to introduce yourself to a stranger. And all the while you are being
guided toward your own awakening. 

And when I said that many are called but few are chosen, I did not say that God
sends out the call and then decides if you are worthy. Many are called but few
are chosen because they choose themselves. Do you see the difference? The
choice is always given you to awaken. 

The greatest of gifts that you can give now is equal to any gift that I ever
gave to the world. It is equal to any gift I ever gave the world and is equal
to it in value and in radiance and in beauty and in Truth. It is the gift of
your being awake, unwilling to tolerate error in yourself for another moment,
saying, "No, no more games. I'm not going to go through this world and pretend
that I am separate from God. I am going to live the Truth that I know is within
me because nothing else matters." 

That is the greatest gift. And I implore you and I ask you as your friend and
as your brother, please give it. Give it with each breath. Just take a nice
deep inhale right now and breathe out any intolerance and error in yourself and
say, "Yes, I must be that one because I exist and I am held lovingly in the
Mind of God. There has been no loss and nothing to atone for, and those that I
love are with me eternally because my Mind embraces the whole of creation." 

It does feel a little lighter, doesn’t it? How are you doing? 

*Great.* 

Would you like to stand and stretch the legs and let the bag of dust move a
bit? 

*Yes.* 

{Stretch break.} 

Sorry to disturb you. 

*You never disturb me.* 

Did you not feel me just now when you were in the other room? 

*I feel you always.* 

Old friend, can you let that cat out of the bag? 

*Please.* 

Indeed. In the field of time we have known one another for a great length of
time. Is that not true? 

*Yes.* 

And you know that you have indeed been called home. 

*Oh, yes.* 

And you have known for some time that somehow I had a role to play in the
weaving of the tapestry that would be created here. Is that not true? 

*Yes.* 

Well, what you call the "voila!" Now, I want to suggest to you, the times that
we have been speaking of here tonight &mdash; that is, the times of celebration &mdash;
visions that you've had concerning this, it's time to really begin to bring
them into being. Does that make sense to you? 

*Yes.* 

So, why not have what you call a kick&mdash;off celebration in which the invitation
goes out to all who will indeed hear &mdash; and you know who they are &mdash; to come to
abide with you with your very, very old friend who is also the mate now, again.
And to come with this clarity. It is nothing new, as you know. It is just a
clarity that has been exposed. The telegram has been sent out now to come
together to truly celebrate the Truth of what is unfolding, to begin to create
that vortex, as you would call it, of energy so that all minds and all hearts,
so called, begin to resonate with it very deeply. What do you think? 

*My dear friend. You know I love you dearly, and I've been in service always and
it is time and the call has gone out and everyone here has heard it at one
level or another and it is very ready. Very very ready. Thank you for coming.
Thank you for being here now. Thank you for choosing to speak so that those
that need to hear can hear. *

Precious friend, you know I can't be anywhere else, and you also know I've
never stopped speaking. I just choose ears that choose to hear. Indeed. 

So, it will be a grand celebration. Much singing, much laughter, much dancing,
much playing, and not a thought or grain of seriousness. Indeed, it will be a
feeling that will come back. It's already within you, but it will come back
within you &mdash; as well as within others &mdash; of ancient times in which you have
danced together and I have been with you. 

And I would share with you that there will not be any such gathering &mdash; you know
as I say this, it's not for you because you already know this &mdash; there will not
be any such gathering that I will not come and abide in that celebration. 

*This I know well.* 

Celebration Director. 

*I accept.* 

It's soon time to speak to the one on whose land you are living, to speak
deeply from the heart, for the time frame that I've spoken to you about is at
hand now and it's time to begin speaking from the heart of an ancient vision
that was once given unto that one. She has been waylaid and has been veiled by
some fears and some hurts. To reach out and to embrace the heart of that one
and to gently allow a remembrance to occur. Speak unto her that I remember her
also and that the time is at hand. 

*Thank you.* 

If it were given unto me to have what you call as a body, I would probably
bring it to this island. Indeed. 

Is anything on your mind? 

*No.* 

Yes, there is. Joy. 

*Joy. Yes, of course, you little mind reader, you.* 

{Laughter.} 

Am I little or is your mind little? 

*Yes, yes. Bring me up here; put me on the spot.* 

Isn't it time to know it's safe to be there and this time there will be no
persecution? 

*Uh huh.* 

Now, many of you felt a sigh of relief because many of you have tasted
persecution. There have been times you've pushed the river. The wrong time.
This time there will not be persecution. Regardless of the belief systems,
regardless of nationalities and all of that nonsense, what is occurring now is
that the collective mind of mankind is beginning to simmer and the lid that has
been on the kettle is beginning to shake and rattle a bit. And as it shakes and
rattles, the Light begins to come in. It's so close, and it really wants to
blow the lid off. And it's only love and celebration that can do that. 

Very soon now that will simply be beyond the age of theologies, beyond the age
of philosophies. What is being reborn is what some have called the Garden of
Eden, if you will &mdash; time when mankind walked with God and knew it and didn't
need a row of textbooks to prove it. And the grand cathedral will be found in
the hearts of everyone. Celebration and gratitude, celebration and gratitude
are now the steppingstones that begin to lift the lid off the kettle. Not
philosophies, not ideas, not theologies. Love itself and only Love. So, have a
good time. 

Within the next six months to a year of your time, there will most probably be
arriving on this island some that come from far distant lands. We speak here
primarily of two or three in particular who will very well&mdash;grounded in Spirit.
They will bring certain gifts that will help to expand the work that will arise
here. Now, I say "probably” because &mdash; don't let anybody kid you &mdash; there's
always free will and things need to be brought into place, but there's already
communication going on with those minds from myself and through some others, as
they step back into alignment with visions that they have had since they were
children. Most probably you will see them arrive in the time frame that I have
spoken unto you of. And that's enough of that. 

Indeed, let the one on whose land you now live, let her know how deeply I love
her. Not one thought she has ever held, not one experience has ever in any way,
shape or form served to taint that love. And I give it to her now as fully as I
have ever offered it. There is, indeed, a purpose and a reason that she's
chosen this incarnation and all of the complexities that placed her in the
position that she's in. There's a part of her that knows it. Let your love and
your embrace of her provide the safety to release the veils of that
remembrance. Fair enough? 

*Yes.* 

Well, doing what is called the will of God is good work if you can get it. The
great blessing is, you can't help but get it. So, thank you. 

*Thank you. Thank you.* 

Indeed. 

So, I am done. 

I am with you always. There cannot be separation between you and myself. There
cannot be. No thought you've ever held, no perception of yourself can separate
you from the Love of God, and I am merely one who once walked upon this plane
and completed the very thing that you are completing: the Atonement, the
recognition that you really are, after all, exactly what God created you to be.
Indeed, that makes us friends. 

I love you, and I will stay and abide with you in this hour in this place as
long as you want if you have what are called questions, for as long as the
gracious owners allow. And she was wondering, she was wondering how could she
ever receive objective validation for her deep inner sense of connectedness
with me? What better way than to pop into her own house? Indeed. 

So, celebrate well because, you see, that yet is the secret to the Kingdom of
Heaven that I shared with my friends; sing, laugh, dance and play every day and
allow outrageousness to be your style. Outrageousness doesn't mean that you
offend anybody. Outrageousness means that you become so, so outrageous as to
simply acknowledge in your heart that you are the holy child of God. No more
and certainly no less. That is outrageous in the eyes of the world that
believes in struggle and loss and pain and fear and death. When you become so
outrageous as to throw such perceptions out the window and to acknowledge that
only love is real, that is what it means to be outrageous. 

Ready to give it a try? 

*Yes. Uh huh.* 

You had to think about it? 

{Laughter.} 

So, do you have questions or would you rather just do all you can to hug each
other to death, to life? It's really up to you.

*I guess it's going to be hugs.* 

Beloved friend, for longer than you know, I have waited for the age to descend
upon this Earth in which the ending of questions is manifested because the
knowingness of Truth is established in every heart. 

When Truth is come, indeed the Truth that sets you free even as it set me free,
what else is left to do but love and dance and embrace your brothers and your
sisters, to celebrate the Truth that you are here not to suffer the world but
to bear witness to the Light that enlightens the world? That is your only
purpose and function, and we share it. And yes, I know that means I'm no longer
special. 

*All right.* 

Thank God. 

{Laughter.} 

Indeed. 

With great love I leave you, and yet I depart not from you but merely borrow
the mind and body, if you will, to make something invisible that is available
to you always for the asking. The simple asking. 

Great is my love for you who have chosen to come again to the field of space
and time because you have loved the world so much that you have given unto it
yourself, the holy child of God. "For God so loved the world that He gave forth
His only begotten Son." Well, who do you think you are? 

You are the one that He has sent forth to bring Light to the world, and I love
you for your willingness to do it. It is not given unto me in this timeframe to
have a body, and it will never be given unto me to have a body. It's not
necessary. And when you begin to hear some rumors and stories of someone on the
other side of the planet who is the incarnation of Christ, remember, the
Kingdom of Heaven dwells within you and that is where I abide – in your heart,
with you always. 

Therefore, peace be unto the holy and only begotten children of Light divine,
who sing and dance and play and laugh together and enlighten the world because
the Truth is in them and it is awake. 

Peace, therefore, be unto you always. The day comes when the things of Heaven
shall be wed with the things of Earth and Truth will be extended as far as from
the East to the West. That's all the cross ever meant. Peace. Peace be unto you
always. 

Amen.
