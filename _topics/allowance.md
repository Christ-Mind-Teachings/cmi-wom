Allowance is the third of the Keys to the Kingdom.

Allowance is the cultivation of a way of looking at the events of your
life, not as obstacles to getting what you want, but as stepping stones, each
of which presents you with a blessing of the lessons required to heal the
obstacles â€” not to success, but to the presence of Love as the source and
ground of your being. In the stage of allowance, then, we begin to cultivate an
acceptance of all things in our experience. We begin to see that because we
have made a commitment to awakening and incarnating only Christ, that the
Universe is already conspiring to bring the people and events into our lives,
on a moment to moment basis, that can best provide us with exactly what we most
need to learn or become aware of.
