## Why is healing necessary?

Healing is not necessary, it's a choice.

## What is healing?

Moving in your consciousness from the world of conflict and fear and guilt and
unworthiness to the world of the Truth of the Kingdom.

World of separation
* not safe
* conflicted
* confused
* fearful
* guilty

World of the Kingdom
* peaceful
* unified
* certain

## What needs to be healed?

* Your perception of the world
* Correction of every erroneous thought you ever held.
* Release the burden of illusion.
* Taking your burden of guilt and judgment from you.
* What you fear and repress, your judgments of the world.
* Your smallness.

## How is healing accomplished

* Only Love heals.
* Love of self
    * Accept your innocence
* Love of others

-----

The process of healing is not difficult. It requires only your willingness to
accept that you are the effect of the Creatorâ€™s desire to create like unto
Itself.

Surrender, then, is the process in which you finally relent, you give up
resisting the fact of your very existence. You stop whining about it. You stop
lamenting it. You stop worrying about it. You make the decision to get on with
being alive! And what is alive about you is going to be alive forever. And
there is no place to hide and nowhere to go.
