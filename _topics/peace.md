Peace is the culmination of the spiritual journey. It becomes the field in
which one has entered the Kingdom and now journeys within it in perfect freedom
&ndash; a freedom that cannot be understood by the minds of mankind that still live
in fear, doubt, separation, and even the most subtle traces of egoism. Peace is
the goal. But Peace is not a passivity. It is really the seat of creative
power. For you were created to create the good, the holy, and the beautiful.
