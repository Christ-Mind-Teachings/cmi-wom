*{{page.source}}* emphasizes four axioms, or statements of truth, that describe
fundamental aspects of our being that we have forgotten or don't believe. It is
the acceptance of these truths as we live our lives that lead us to awakening.

The first axiom:

Nothing which you are experiencing is caused by anything outside of you. You
experience only the effects of your own choice.
