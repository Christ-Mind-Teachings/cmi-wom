Desire is the first of the Keys to the Kingdom. It is the first factor in awakening
or changing anything. Everything is the effect of desire.

And yet, we often feel conflicted about desire and have been taught that desire
is evil. The *Way of Mastery* teaches that desire is not to be feared but it is
to be mastered.

Desire is something welling up from the depth beyond yourself that can be looked
at with perfect innocence and with the wonder of a child. Turning to allow and 
welcome desire is not something that will sidetrack you from the path of awakening
but will take you vertically into the Heart of God.
