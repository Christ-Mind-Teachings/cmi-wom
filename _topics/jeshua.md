Jeshua, also known as Jesus, is the source of the Way of Mastery material. Spend a
little time here and you will discover a loving and patient older brother who
walks with us on our journey from confusion and conflict to certainty and peace. He
knows the way and can be trusted completely.

Listen carefully as he sheds light on areas of your deepest confusion and demonstrates
the way to transform your life through his example. His words point the way and his
example is the inspiration to put the words into practice. 

These are words that come from 'out of this world', they are founded in love, compassion,
and the recognition that we are all one. They are *totally* opposite from what the
world teaches and it may take several sittings to understand the magnitude of the
gift that is offered.

Imagine your life with no fear. Imagine a life of peace and compassion that can ease
the suffering of the world. This is the promise that he brings. Its a big promise and
one not exaggerated, which he never does. Talk about words that are totally opposite
from what the world teaches!

This topic highlights what Jeshua has said within The Way of Mastery about himself,
his motivation, his life when he walked the earth as a man, and more. He is our
guiding light and example.
