{: .cmi-topic-title}

Christ is a state of consciousness, a way of being. It is not a person but is a state
of consciousness available to all. This topic explores the qualities and experience
of one abiding in Christ consciousness.

The *Way of Mastery* is a pathway that leads us, lovingly, to the lived experience
of Christ so it is important to know what that is. A major exercise given in the text
is to 'sit for five minutes as Christ' and in so doing to learn what Christ is. 

Christ is our right mind. It is what remains when the thought of the personal
self has been relinquished. It is what it means to be awakened. The acceptance
of Christ as what we are is the Atonement, the end of illusion and the end of
the experience of separation.

Christ is the only thing that we've ever really wanted.
