*{{page.source}}* emphasizes four axioms, or statements of truth, that describe
fundamental aspects of our being that we have forgotten or don't believe. It is
the acceptance of these truths as we live our lives that lead us to awakening.

The fourth axiom:

The only relationship which holds any value at all is your relationship with God, your
creative Source, the depth of the ocean.
