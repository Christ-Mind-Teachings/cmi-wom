Intention is the second of the Keys to the Kingdom.

In The Way of the Heart, intention doesn’t mean putting your nose to the
grindstone and not taking “no” for an answer. It means, rather, that you
cultivate within your thought processes the art of remembering what you are
truly here for. You are here to remember that you are the thought of Love in
form. You are here to remember that you are One with God. You are here to
remember that what I have called Abba, the Father, though it goes by many
names, is the source of your only reality. And you are living in reality only
to the degree that That One is living through you.
