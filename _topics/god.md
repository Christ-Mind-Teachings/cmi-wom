If you've ever cringed at the thought of God or wondered why a 'loving' God
would allow a world like ours, read on, there's plenty to contemplate. You
wont find answers to all your questions but you will get a start.

God is pure unconditional radiant Love, pure intelligence, and the source of
all Creation.  God extends Creation so that he might be aware of Himself in an
endless variety of form. There is nothing that you see that is not pervaded by
the Perfect Radiance of God's Holy Presence.

Christ is God's only creation. You are literally the Field of Awareness of God
in which God has awareness of Himself. Made of the very substance of that
overwhelming Love and playfulness, you have the power to create infinitely, and
thereby extend Creation Itself.

God is Reality, there can be nothing outside of what God Is. God is Love. The
Love which God is is incomprehensible forever. God is a mystery closer to you
than your own breath.
