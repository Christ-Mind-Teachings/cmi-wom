*{{page.source}}* emphasizes four axioms, or statements of truth, that describe
fundamental aspects of our being that we have forgotten or don't believe. It is
the acceptance of these truths as we live our lives that lead us to awakening.

The third axiom:

You do not live any "ordinary" moments.

## Links to other Axioms

* [**Axiom One**](/t/wom/topics/axiom1/){:data-topic="Axiom One"}: You experience only
  the effects of your own choice.
* [**Axiom Two**](/t/wom/topics/axiom2/){:data-topic="Axiom Two"}: I need do nothing.
* [**Axiom Four**](/t/wom/topics/axiom4/){:data-topic="Axiom Four"}: The only relationship
  that holds any value at all is your relationship with God.

## How *{{page.title}}* relates to other topics

* If each moment is not ordinary it must be *extraordinary*. Therefore:
    * Learning to [**trust**](/t/wom/topics/trust/){:data-topic="Trust"} and [**allow**](/t/wom/topics/allowance/){:data-topic="Allowance"} each moment
      is important.
    * [**Use time wisely**](/t/wom/topics/usetime/){:data-topic="Use Time Wisely"}.
    * Use each moment to allow [**perception**](/t/wom/topics/perception/){:data-topic="Perception"}
      to be [**healed**](/t/wom/topics/healing/){:data-topic="Healing"}.
* You are not in the [**world**](/t/wom/topics/world/){:data-topic="World"} at all but in a context made new by your desire
  to [**awaken**](/t/wom/topics/awakening/){:data-topic="Awaken"} which invited the [**Holy Spirit**](/t/wom/topics/holyspirit/){:data-topic="Holy Spirit"}
  to guide the way.
