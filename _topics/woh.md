The Way of the Heart is a pathway of awakening that was taught to Jeshua and
has as its foundation the truth that is true always:

I am Pure Spirit, undefiled and unaffected by anything or anyone. I am given
full power to choose and, therefore, to create my experience as I would have it
be.
{:.cmi-tsi}

This is an expression of the first of the four Axioms of Truth that are fundamental
to the Way of the Heart.

It is that pathway which cultivates within you the decision to turn your
attention upon your own mind, upon your own behavior, upon what is true and
real for you, moment to moment â€” to study it, to consider it, to feel it, to
breathe the Light of Spirit through it, and to constantly retrain the mind so
that it assumes complete responsibility in each moment.

We are in school, life is our way home and the Way of the Heart is our guide.
