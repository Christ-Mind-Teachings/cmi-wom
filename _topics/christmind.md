You are merely that quiet, and that presence, that observes all of Creation
flowing through a field of awareness which is the Mind of Christ. Unlimited
forever, are you. Unchanging forever, are you. Perfectly changeless, are you.
And we are of one substance, one Light, and one Truth. Here alone, does reality
reside. Here alone, is reality remembered. Here alone, Love reigns supreme.
Here alone, is where you are.
