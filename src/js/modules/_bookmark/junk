"(p29) By retraining your mind through the humility of recognizing that you
don’t know what a single thing is for, that your only choice that you would
make is to know and remember and live in the peace of God, the mind will come
to be restructured, to be cleansed and purified and you will look out upon a
world transfigured and you will see shining through it the reflection of the
real world. You will know that you are fear–less, for there is no longer a self
that requires your constant protection against the great forces that seem to
stand against it. For there can be no great force standing against the true
self, that which shines radiantly with you, throughout you, and throughout all
of creation. And that self is the real world.(p30) You are that one, shimmering
brightly, far greater than ten thousand suns. And when you look upon the
vastness of your sky, realize that it merely reflects a speck of the light in
which it itself has emerged and that light is you. All worlds, all dimensions,
all planes of existence arises from within your Holy Mind. You are the great
vastness that contains creation even now. And even now in reality you abide and
live and exist only in the real world. And the only distance between you in the
real world and the you that you think you are in the unreal world is the width
of a thought that you would insist on thinking."
