### Way of the Heart, Lesson Twelve: Question Test

On the day of your crucifixion, it was told that you spoke the words,

“Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?” 

Can you elaborate on that? Will you?

### Answer

That is always the proper question. 

First, I have, indeed, given forth this answer to a certain one that
you’re aware of.

We would highly suggest that you merely obtain that answer, for it was
not given to be kept and held in privacy.

Now, we would amend it by saying that I’ve
felt guilty about that statement ever since. [Laughter]

Beloved friend, if I have not touched every kernel of humanity and the
experience of it that you have known, it is useless for you to listen to
me.

And I have nothing to offer you.

It is a very good question, but in the end, bring it around a little
further and ask of *yourself*,

> Why have I said, “Father, why have you forsaken me?”

Something to be pondered.
