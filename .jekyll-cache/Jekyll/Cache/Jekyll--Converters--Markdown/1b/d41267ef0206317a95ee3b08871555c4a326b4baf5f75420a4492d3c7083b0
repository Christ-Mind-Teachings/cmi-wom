<p>Is there truly any difference between entities that describe themselves
as Germaine, Jeshua, Michael, and who would bring their message through
an individual? Is there really any difference among the messengers?</p>

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>

<p>The answer is a resounding yes. And why? When you speak of difference,
what you are alluding to is that is there an entity that is its own
unique sphere of consciousness arising out of the One Mind. God is aware
of God because of God’s creation. You are God’s creation. Therefore, the
Father knows Himself because <em>you</em> exist to be aware of Him.
Individuation, like the ripple arising out of the ocean, does not change
the substance — it’s still all made of one thing — and yet, there is
individuation, uniqueness, just as there are several souls associated
with the bodies that have gathered in this room, and you all have your
own unique, cosmic social security number.</p>

<p>Will it be bankrupt when we get there?</p>

<p>No, it is always, shall we say, overflowing. And you don’t even have to
pay into it!</p>

<p>So, understand, then, that when we speak of One Mind, we are not saying
that individuality does not exist. We’re merely saying that each being,
each created being, has within them the power to operate from the One
Mind that I have called Christed Consciousness. It can go by many names.
And yet, individuation is eternal. There will never be a time, a moment,
or a non-moment, when all of you simply dissolve into some amorphous
blob of awareness. In other words, the more you settle into God, the
more the desire there is to individuate, so that you can have
relationship in which to celebrate the good, the holy, and the
beautiful — to dance, eternally at play in the Father’s Kingdom.</p>

<p>Does that help in that regard?</p>

<p>Most definitely.</p>

<p>Now, by the way, I would highly suggest that I would never listen to the
Germaine fellow. And Michael sometimes is a little… Hmmm. Just kidding,
of course.</p>

<p>And Mary shops at K-Mart.</p>

<p>Mmm… I’ve never been able to keep that one under control. Rest assured,
we delight with one another, we play with one another, we <em>see</em> the
Creator, we <em>see</em> the presence of God <em>as each of us,</em> and we respect
our individuation, just as you respect yours. To see the oneness in
diversity, to experience communion between two wholes — that is the
great promise of the Kingdom. To be in holy relationship in which two
Christs, as individuated beings, yet emerging from and operating from
the same mind, the same values, the same love, the same compassion, the
same wisdom, the same unlimited power to create the good, the holy, and
the beautiful … Now <em>that is a dance worth attending</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, seek not the death of the self, but seek the arisen Self. Hm?
That should help.</p>
