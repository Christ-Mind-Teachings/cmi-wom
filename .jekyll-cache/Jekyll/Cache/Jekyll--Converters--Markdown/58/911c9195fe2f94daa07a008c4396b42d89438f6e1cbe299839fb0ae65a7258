I"|ﬁ<p>Now we begin.</p>

<p>And yet once again I say unto you that it is with great joy that I come
forth to abide with you‚Äîand often I have said that. And yet, have you
truly sought to comprehend what those words mean?‚Äî‚Äúthat it is in joy
that I come forth to abide with you.‚Äù And if I come in this rather
particular way to abide with you so that your body can sit there and
this body, temporarily borrowed, can sit here, and I can come and abide
with you in this manner, rest assured that I come always with joy to
abide with you where you really are. You do not abide within a body. The
body, again, arises within a field that can be called your
consciousness. It is born out of your desire, your expectations, your
perceptions that have been built up and built up and built up. And one
of those perceptions is indeed that you are within the body. But you are
not.</p>

<p>Therefore, I come not to abide with the body, but I come forth to abide
with that great ray of Light that you are, that shines forever beyond
the body and beyond all worlds. It is to that great ray of Light that I
speak and with that great ray of Light that I commune. And the process
of awakening, the process of the atonement, is not just some mental
gymnastics in which you try to exercise certain statements in which you
say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, good. I‚Äôm one with God. It doesn‚Äôt quite feel that way but I‚Äôll
believe it anyway.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is where it begins. But the atonement is indeed completed when the
whole sense of identity that you carry is no longer in any way, shape or
form limited to the space and volume of the body. There isn‚Äôt even a
trace of identification with it save that you acknowledge that you have
allowed it to arise within the field of the Light you are. And it serves
no other purpose save to be a means by which you communicate the Light
that you are into this plane of density and to this world of yours.</p>

<p>If this were not true, it would mean that you are not as God, our Holy
Father, has created you to be. And I have said many times, in many ways,
that God has but one creation‚ÄîHis holy and precious child; His Son, if
you will; that which is the offspring of the Mind of God. And that which
is an offspring of Light, that is made in the image of Light, can only
be Light, filled with wisdom, filled with creativity, filled with
‚Ä¶ joy.</p>

<p>Therefore, I come forth in joy because joy is that in which I abide
eternally, and I come forth to abide with you. Not the body that you
think you are. Not the body that you think you are in, but I come forth
to abide with that great ray of Light that outshines all worlds and is
forever one with me since before the foundation of all worlds.</p>

<p>And the miracle, the miracle that allows the atonement to be born on
Earth‚Äîwhich means in the body‚Äîeven as it is already completed in Heaven,
the miracle that allows that is the simplicity of your willingness to
set aside, constantly, everything about what you believe that you are,
so that you can relearn the Truth.</p>

<p>And if I were to come to you and speak to you as though you were a body
and if I were to acquiesce to your insistence that you are just this
form, that you are just your hurts, that you are just your limitations,
if I were to come and abide with that, there could be no such thing as a
miracle. For it would mean that both of us have gotten caught up in the
insanity of an illusion.</p>

<p>Precious friends, I abide only with‚Äîand speak only to‚Äîthe great ray of
Light that you are, that outshines every limitation that you believe
exists in and as your life. And it is to that ray of Light that I gently
whisper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Awaken. Awaken from sleep and put away the things of dreams. Put away
fears and put away doubts, and begin instead to focus the whole of
your attention on Light and on joy.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And why?</p>

<p>If this world has been made in error‚Äîand I assure you that it has‚Äîand if
the world is diametrically opposed to the Truth of the Kingdom of
Heaven, it must then follow that the perceptions and beliefs that have
made this world are indeed the opposite of a knowledge that you can find
in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>The world is made of fear. The world is made of limitation. That is the
world that you have taken to be real and, therefore, have allowed it to
dictate to you what choices you will make in your life: where you will
live, the friends you will attract to yourself.</p>

<p><em>Every last aspect of your life has come forth out of the perception
that you are a body, separate from everyone else, that you live in this
world and that this world is real.</em></p>

<p>This world is constructed in separation, fear and guilt. Therefore, if
you perceive it as the real world, you must then attract to yourself
that which mirrors what you are insisting on believing in. And yet, I
say, week in and week out: I come forth in joy to abide with you. Not
with your illusions, not your dreams, but the real you, the real you
that is filled with power and Light and goodness and love and capability
and creativity; and you name it, you are it.</p>

<p><em>If you name it, you will be it. What you decree you become.</em></p>

<p>So, if I come forth in joy and I come forth from the Kingdom of Heaven,
the Kingdom of Heaven itself must be a state, if you will‚Äîa quality, if
you will‚Äîin which nothing can sneak in through the back door unless it
is more joy. Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>If a limited thought emerges and comes and sneaks into the Kingdom of
Heaven, Heaven is no longer Heaven, so who would want to be there
anyway? Not I. If there is a trace of shadow in the Kingdom of Heaven,
it‚Äôs no longer Heaven. If there is a doubt or feeling of psychological
weakness, if that abides in Heaven, then it is beneath who you are and
you might as well throw it away; it‚Äôs no good to you.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Heaven is a state and a quality of such joyousness that
what takes place is that the Light that you are begins to vibrate at a
higher and higher frequency until the things that arise in your world
that seem to be limiting you don‚Äôt even matter any longer. And that is
extremely important, and that‚Äôs what I want to speak with you about this
evening.</p>

<p>If when what you would perceive as a limitation pops up in your life,
rest assured it is coming forth to reveal to you that there is a shadow
of perception, of thought, of feeling that is less than whole
joyousness, if you will, that yet needs to be, shall we say, corrected
within you.</p>

<p>Now, the mind, through its habits, will look at the limitation that
arises and believe that the limitation is real and, therefore will, in a
sense, step the vibration down to match the vibration of the limitation
so that you can do battle with it. Do you know what that feels like? It
is called ‚Äúbeating the head against a brick wall.‚Äù Now, who is the
builder? Who is the bricklayer? You are.</p>

<p>Enlightenment, empowerment, whole joyousness, if you will, cannot begin
until you are willing to accept total and complete responsibility for
everything you see, everything you think, everything you say and
everything you do‚Äîbut, above all, everything you feel, because the
causative factor of what you feel and what you perceive is never outside
of you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, surely that must be wrong. When the landlord raises the rent
and I don‚Äôt feel good, surely it is the act of the rent being raised
that causes the feeling that I am having?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is what the world will teach you and what it would ask you to
believe, but remember, the perceptions of the world are just the
opposite of the Truth of the Kingdom.</p>

<p><em>Can you begin, then, to allow yourself to admit, to consider, that
every feeling and every perception has no cause outside of you?</em> Each
time you believe that it does you have chosen, you have decreed like a
judge with the gavel, you have judged that the world outside of you is
real and contains a power over you. That choice occurs nowhere save
within yourself, within the mind that you are, and it requires something
quite fundamental: it requires that in that very moment you have set
aside the remembrance of yourself as a great ray of Light. You have
given back your God-given power and have chosen an illusion to be your
authority.</p>

<p>So then, can you understand the great blessing of each moment? The Holy
Spirit has already translated the world that has been brought forth in
error, that you‚Äôve gotten a little caught up with, into the very means
whereby you can awaken from the dream of separation, re-identify with
the Light that you are and, therefore, outshine everything that has
represented the world to you. Every anger, every hurt, every fear, every
limitation, every empty wallet; whatever it is, you can outshine it. You
can actually change the whole picture because you are using your Light
to create the world that you see and have believed in.</p>

<p>And what is the key that unlocks that? Joy.</p>

<p>Joy is not just a word. It is not just a temporary feeling. Joy is
something that you have complete control over twenty-four hours a day.
It is a vibration. It is a frequency. And if you were to go into one of
your laboratories and say to one of your scientists,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, show me the frequency and color of sadness,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>you could guess that it might be dark gray. And the frequency of love
carries a quality of, shall we say, pinks and light violets to it. The
frequency of joy vibrates at a very high color, if you will, of vibrant,
radiant golden light that you can‚Äôt even really tell if it‚Äôs gold or
white.</p>

<p>It is a vibration. It is a frequency. It is a tangible reality. It is a
real doodad, if you will, that floats with all the other doodads in this
universe, and you can claim it as yours every time you choose to
remember the Truth. You can choose to open up the body even and
literally draw that joy down through the crown of the head. You can draw
it up through the soles of the feet. You can draw it in from the sides.
It doesn‚Äôt matter, that‚Äôs just ritual.</p>

<p>The point is, you are enacting your choice to remember the Truth that
you were born in joy, that you were created in joy, that you are
sustained in joy, that joy is who and what you are. And out of joy comes
the power to do all things, manifest all things, impact all things,
change all things, heal all things‚Äîand to dance through all things.</p>

<p>Joy. Joy is the key that unlocks the door. When you have indeed desired
first the Kingdom; and when your intention has been unwavering; and when
you have learned to master the key of allowing in which you learn to
forgive the world, to forgive yourself, to trust all things that arise
so that you can begin to look at them with new eyes and learn how you
are the creator of all that you have experienced; as you rest then into
the safety of surrender, the Holy Spirit comes by with a little golden
key and says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Here is what you have been looking for. I couldn‚Äôt give it to you
earlier because you were too busy running around in small circles in
the mind. But now that the mind of the world has been set aside, I can
speak to you clearly, and I deliver to you the key whereby you begin
to translate the unhappy dream that you may have created, or aspects
of it, into a happy dream.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A wholly happy dream in which perhaps relationships that have actually
been what you would call in your language ‚Äúdysfunctional‚Äù‚Äîquite an apt
word, by the way‚Äîor harmful or limiting, you‚Äôve finally learned that
it‚Äôs okay to set them aside, that it‚Äôs okay for you to choose joy. It‚Äôs
okay for you to be happy. It‚Äôs okay for you to be wealthy. It doesn‚Äôt
matter what it is. It‚Äôs okay. And the key that unlocks it all is Joy.</p>

<p>So, all you have to do when next you are feeling a little down is sit
here and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am wholly joyous now.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then open your eyes, and if everything‚Äôs the same, you can rest assured
that the key of joy doesn‚Äôt work. Some do that. They make a meager
attempt. They make it from a mind that has become depressed, a body
filled with toxins that has become tight and depressed. They make it
from the foundation of the perceptions of the world. They give a thought
to joy. Nothing changes overnight.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>So, Jeshua must not know what he‚Äôs talking about. And not only him
but I understand there have been a lot of masters around that have
talked about joy, and they have all been wrong because I just proved
it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have learned to not punch your joy button constantly, if it‚Äôs at
best become an intermittent thing, so that at times you choose to be
joyous if the situation looks okay and other times decide to hold on to
judgment and thoughts of limitation and lack‚Äî if you have learned to do
it that way, must it not follow that to re-identify with yourself as joy
will also require the process of learning?</p>

<p>We have talked about how the Holy Spirit translates the things of time
into the very means by which you may awaken. Therefore, be thankful for
the time that is given to you for it is the means by which you will
relearn how to not only press, but to hold your joy button until it
holds itself. It is the means whereby the translation of an unhappy
dream occurs so that a happy one replaces it. And as the dream becomes
happy, what happens? Something that everybody knows. Anytime you feel
relatively happy, you relax. You expand. You open. You become more
creative. You feel more in tune, more alive. The cells of the body sing.
That‚Äôs why everybody likes being happy.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have learned to believe that happiness is a
conditional expression. That is, it depends on external circumstances.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I will be happy, when‚Ä¶</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, of course, ‚Äúwhen‚Äù never comes. And if it arrives, because you
haven‚Äôt learned how to be happy, you feel uncomfortable. And many of you
know what that‚Äôs like.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Now that I have what I have been seeking, I can‚Äôt quite be happy
yet.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? Because you forgot to practice being happy.</p>

<p>Now, joy, then‚Äîand that is why we began last week with <em>feeling</em> joy‚Äîas
you practice becoming the frequency of joy, something begins to happen.
And all of you know this to some degree. It‚Äôs just a matter of making it
constant. When you choose to, shall we say, abide and to vibrate in the
frequency of the Light of the joy that you are, no matter what is coming
up around you, when you choose joy, when you draw the Light in through
the toes, through the fingernails . . . it doesn‚Äôt matter, just do it,
let the body begin to vibrate. It will feel like the body is vibrating
at any rate. Feel the Light, feel the joy . . . it actually begins to
blow the cobwebs out, out of the cells of the body and out of the mind,
the Mind in which you are already connected with me and with God and
with every mind that has ever awakened. Every master that has ever been
is no further than a phone call away from within your mind.</p>

<p>Many have said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Gee, I have been trying but I just can‚Äôt hear you, Jeshua. I just . .
. meditation doesn‚Äôt go well. What‚Äôs going on?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs because there is static in the mind‚Äîlike a cloudy day that blocks
the sun.</p>

<p><em>The sun that truly shines, dwells within your heart‚Äînow. Not one thing
separates you from your right and your power to choose to dwell in the
joy that is the presence of the Light of the Son of God that dwells
within your heart.</em></p>

<p>As you choose that frequency and vibration, miracles accelerate. The
picture that you have created, called your life, begins to vibrate a
little, you see, because it always responds to the frequency that you
are living in. You could say that the world is your perfect servant, and
it will always show you exactly where your frequency is.</p>

<p>As you choose that vibration, you could say that you begin to vibrate
the molecules of matter. You begin to break up the old picture so that
that which does not resonate with the frequency of joy that you are
choosing to live within, those things begin to have a few earthquakes.
And if you are willing to allow them, they will drop out of your life.</p>

<p>Now this is a big stumbling block, you see, because part of the mind is
still attached to believing that its identity, its reality, is made up
of the things outside of it; so that as you choose awakening, as you
choose joy, all the little fears that you‚Äôve been carrying begin to
float to the surface and you have a choice to make. Love or fear? Ever
heard that before?</p>

<p>The way is easy and without effort, and yet it takes you through the eye
of the needle. The way <em>is</em> the way of love and love is the expression
of joy‚Äîa joy that must spill over into every dimension of your
experience until every dimension of it mirrors to you the happy dream of
your constant union with God. And then the world itself fades away; you
transcend the world.</p>

<p>There is a process to go through. It is a process that will take you
from where you think you are to where you long to be. And the process
requires that willingness <em>to</em> <em>trust love</em>, to trust love to carry you
beyond every fear that has ever limited you and ever made you believe
that you can only be who you are now.</p>

<p>Fear can arise when the things that you have constructed out of
misperceptions, whether they be relationships, careers, whatever it is,
if you have made it from the perspective of the ego rest assured its
foundation is a house built on sand and it is going to crumble sooner or
later. Your world, you see, is one in which you are taught to strive, to
struggle, to feel anxiety, to try to keep your creations on solid
ground.</p>

<p>You have many people, by the way, that are locked up in mental
institutions for no other reason than they see through the game of the
ego and they realize any such construction is made on a foundation of
sand, so what‚Äôs the point? And they don‚Äôt want to participate.
Unfortunately, your world isn‚Äôt quite ready to go to them and teach them
another way; and so they are caught in what is called hell.</p>

<p>Beloved friends, be of good courage:</p>

<p><em>When you have truly relinquished every attempt to make and control your
world, fear will arise, rest assured. But it is just to show you where
you‚Äôve been living; and just beyond it is the peace that you seek.</em></p>

<p>And each time you choose joy, no matter what, you, shall we say, pass an
initiation would be one way to put it. You step to the next highest
level and a strength begins to come into you, a strength that shall
indeed become like a mighty river and the things of this world will not
deter you from the path that would be set before you and that you would
choose to walk.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit requires enlightened and therefore empowered minds to
join with It, with Him, in the translation of the whole of this world
into a happy dream. Does it require strength? Indeed it does. Is it
going to feel uncomfortable at times? Yes‚Äîto the degree that you try to
hold on to old habits, whether they be habits of diet, habits of
thought, habits of relationship, habits of career. If you believe those
things are keeping you safe, you are going to go through quite a
struggle because once you choose to awaken, that is like you have taken
your finger out of the hole in the dam and the water begins to pour
forth‚Äîfirst as trickle, but eventually the power and the force of that
water of joy, of Truth and of Light will break down the dam completely.
If you resist that, you are going to feel fearful and believe that
everything is crumbling to dust; and it is. And yet, what crumbles is
only an illusion, only something that has limited the holy Son of God.</p>

<p>If I walk with you, your way is certain and fear need not master you.
And the situations that are presented to you in your life are there so
that you can recognize what you are now, as a soul, choosing to
overcome, to grow beyond. Stop trying to keep the things that limit you
in place and give yourself wholly to the force of the water that is the
joy of the soul that would break the dam down so that the river can
flow. The river of creativity. The river of joy. The river of eternal
life that flows from the Mind of God to and through the Son of God, to
be demonstrated and spilled over into this world.</p>

<p><em>I can never make that choice for you.</em> Never. I can only whisper to
you. I can only come to you. I can only abide with you, the Truth in
you. And I can tell you that it‚Äôs safe. It‚Äôs safe to let the false
constructs dissolve from your mind. It is safe and it is necessary, and
if you would receive it, contemplate what this means: it is
<em>inevitable</em>.</p>

<p>I have said many times that freedom does not mean‚Äîfree will does not
mean‚Äîthat you can choose whether or not to take a certain curriculum.
You are only free to decide <em>when</em> you are going to take it. And the
reluctance of the mind to truly take the course, live it and master it
(the curriculum), is that part of the mind that wishes summer vacation
could at least last a little bit longer. But all the time you think you
are enjoying your summer vacation, you are not really getting anywhere,
and it takes a resolve‚Äîdesire and intention‚Äîin which, whatever it takes,
you finally voice within yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>No, I‚Äôm not going to tolerate error in myself any longer under any
circumstances. I am the holy Son of God, and joy is my birthright and
my Kingdom and I am going to be that. And if it kills me, good.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a strength in you, a strength you haven‚Äôt even begun to touch,
a strength that when embraced will indeed dismantle every limitation
that you believed exists in your life. And the right use of that
strength rests on your willingness and your determination to choose joy
always.</p>

<p>You see, when you get in your automobile and you leave your humble
abode, and you are about to go off to what you call a job‚Ä¶ Hmm.
Interesting concept. You are not going to a job at all. You are only
choosing to go to what you have chosen to construct out of the infinite
freedom of the molecules of physicality. You are an artist and you have
painted a picture for yourself to abide within. What you are really
doing is getting into your automobile that is a temple, a temple in
which you have ten minutes, twenty minutes, an hour, whatever it is that
you‚Äôve painted for yourself, in which to practice being the presence of
joy. That‚Äôs the curriculum. And it‚Äôs presented to you in every moment.</p>

<p><em>Every moment that you step forward into is a precious and holy temple
in which you have the opportunity to choose fear or love.</em></p>

<p>And you will know if you have chosen the door labeled ‚Äúfear‚Äù because you
might feel tired, sad, confused, depressed. And you will know if you
have chosen the door marked ‚Äújoy‚Äù that comes from choosing love because,
you see, if you are in your automobile, if you are making breakfast, if
you are paying bills, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you are doing‚Äîit‚Äôs not
going to matter because it, itself, is part of the dream that is being
translated, and it is your willingness to abide in joy that will allow
you to heal every limited thought that you have ever had. And each
limited thought has been made manifest as the nemesis of problems that
come to your life. It‚Äôs all the result of a lack of joy.</p>

<p>Can it be that simple? Yes, it is. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Joy is an incredible thing. An incredible blessing. Every time you
choose to be wholly joyous, rest assured you have decided not to
identify with the ego. And remember, you are asked to do only one thing:
to live as though you are not an ego. Every time a judgment slips
through the mind and is projected onto someone,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oops, I misidentified.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take it back. Burn it up. Laugh and get on with joy.</p>

<p>Joy is like a light, like a fire that purifies the mind, that purifies
the body. And why is that necessary? Because your Father longs to have
you join Him as a co-creator and an awakened, healed mind. Such a mind‚Äôs
creations are always loving, always expansive, always healing. The
creations of an awakened mind seem to attract other minds to it like
moths to a light bulb. And that is exactly what is happening.</p>

<p>Your Father longs to pour forth the fullness of His power and creativity
through you. But if you‚Äôve closed yourself off so tight that only a
trickle comes through, just enough to keep the body alive, is there any
wonder that there is lack mirrored to you in your life?</p>

<p>Now, some will say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I‚Äôm a pretty happy guy. I live in a high state of joy most of the
time.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the word ‚Äúmost.‚Äù And understand that if there is anything in the
world that you are still judging, still fearful of, still condemning,
whether it be your monetary system, your government, your schools, your
mass transit systems, garbage strikes‚Äî whatever it is, if you are
judging it, you are blocking off the flow of joy that would transform
the whole of your life.</p>

<p>I have said often to you: become wholly outrageous. And outrageousness
requires‚Ä¶</p>

<p>joy. Joy! Has anybody dropped the bag off their shoulder underneath one
of your lights at the intersection this week? <a href="/wom/early/joy1/">Reference to Joy
I</a></p>

<p>[Laughter.]</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt have the courage.</p>

<p>Beloved friend, when you can say to me, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have the bag‚Ä¶‚Äù
Indeed.</p>

<p>What I am seeking to share with you is that the world you have dreamed
into being‚Äî with all of its complexities, including the body‚Äîis really
no big deal. It‚Äôs quite harmless and holds no power over you. Each time
you see something that seems to be a limitation, realize you are just
looking at the boundary of your mind that you have chosen for yourself.
Now, there is a great power in that because if you recognize the
boundary of your mind but you know that what you really want is joy, you
can choose to walk through that ring of fear, whatever it is. And just
like stretching a muscle, the boundary expands. And as the boundary
expands, more joy flows from the Mind of God through you. More creative
ideas‚Äîand more responsibility.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Damn. I was hoping to get rid of that.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you see how the world would teach you to fantasize about winning a
lottery so that you could be irresponsible? Isn‚Äôt that true? So you
won‚Äôt have any ‚Äúworries.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>Worries are only the refusal to assume responsibility.</em> And yet,
paradoxically when you join with me in being willing to assume
responsibility for the atonement for the whole of creation‚Äîwhew, now
there is an eighty-hour-a-week job‚Äîparadoxically, your joy becomes full
and you rest in what is eternal.</p>

<p>For when you have expanded the boundaries of your mind to allow joy to
be the fountain in which you swim always, and when that deep part of the
mind within you that is the Mind of Christ says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>All of creation is arising within me. This is my doing. Therefore,
I‚Äôm going to heal it and I‚Äôm going to correct it and I assume
responsibility for the whole of the world</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>without jumping ahead to how you are going to take care of that‚Äîthen the
Father pours forth into you the power and the wisdom and the Light and
the life to achieve your goal of healing the whole of creation and
completing the atonement.</p>

<p>First things first.</p>

<p>This temple, the body, is the means whereby it is given unto you to
extend love; and love can only radiate from a mind that is wholly
joyous. Now, you all know that when you are in the presence of somebody
that is not wholly joyous, you are not quite as attracted to them. Isn‚Äôt
that true?</p>

<p>The body deserves your love. Not because it‚Äôs your home but because it
is your tool. And when you abide with only loving thoughts, you will
find that such things as diet, all of those habits that you have, begin
to naturally correct themselves. As you come to love the body by resting
in the joy that is within you, you will indeed find miracles, for you
will be attracted to new ways of being in and with the body itself. And
that‚Äôs a very important step, not one to be rationalized away by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, all I need to do is zap myself with a little Light and nothing
really hurts it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you sure?</p>

<p>If you are not sure, be honest with yourself and take steps to correct
what you are putting into it. The body, this thing that starts here
[pointing to head] and ends at your toes, is like a transmitter and
receiver. As you choose to tune it up, it becomes capable of radiating
higher frequencies of joy. As you choose the frequency of joy, the
desire to tune up the tool naturally grows.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs Step One. And Step Two is to realize that no one is responsible
for your thoughts save you. No one can change them. No one can heal
them. No one is responsible for causing them but you. At first that
seems to be a bit of a bummer because it means indeed accepting total
responsibility, complete responsibility without an excuse, without
claiming victimhood. And yet, claiming that responsibility is what
empowers you. It empowers you to be willing, finally, to be able to
choose to be wholly joyous.</p>

<p>And as you begin to tune into that frequency and you get a little bit of
a shockwave going,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Whew, that was nice. Should I try it again? Oh, why not,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and you open up and you say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Father, I‚Äôm ready. Just pour it down through me. I dare You to
overwhelm me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He‚Äôll try. He loves to try to do that. And then next the little
shockwave goes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Whoops. Well, that was nice, too, and I didn‚Äôt even need another body
to get it. I didn‚Äôt need to go to the movies. I didn‚Äôt need to win the
lottery. What caused it? My God, I did. No causative factor outside my
desire, my willingness, to feel joy.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the more and more and more that you tune to that frequency, you will
find that your Father‚Äôs cup overflows and never stops flowing. And every
moment can become more joyful than the one before, and who cares what
the circumstances are.</p>

<p>As you tune into that frequency, the life that you have been living will
begin to shift and change. Just remember that you are like a painter who
takes a look at the color and says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>That‚Äôs not quite right. I‚Äôm going to erase it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a new color will come, and with that new color might be new friends,
might be a new career. You might find yourself getting up at 3am for
prayer and meditation. You might find a desire to discipline yourself
just a little bit more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, God. Jeshua is talking about responsibility and discipline
tonight. I knew I should have gone to the movies.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Laughter.]</p>

<p><em>Responsibility is what makes your joy full!</em> Please remember that.
Responsibility for the whole of creation is what will make your joy
full.</p>

<p>Discipline? The terrible art of loving yourself. You have a statement
regarding the improper use of some substances that seem to change the
biochemistry of the body: drugs. The statement is ‚ÄúJust say no.‚Äù
Discipline is the art of loving yourself, truly loving yourself, and
saying ‚Äúno‚Äù when you can tell that to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù will be to compromise
your frequency of joy. Sounds simple, doesn‚Äôt it? Rest assured, if you
practice that simple little test of never saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to something that
compromises your frequency of joy, you will be in for a surprise because
what will be revealed to you is how many times in each day you do
compromise your joy,</p>

<p>Know you that which is called ‚Äúthe rat-race?‚Äù Know you that which feels
like conflict? Like you keep trying to get out of it but your feet keep
getting stuck more in it? It comes because, to some degree, you
compromise your joy and then the soul within you becomes sad. And when
you become sad, your frequency drops and you find yourself butting the
head against the wall because you yet believe that that wall keeps you
safe somehow. It stops you from growing. It stops you from becoming
more. It stops you from stepping into the arenas you thought you could
never perform well in. The brick wall is your limitation and it keeps
you in hell, pure and simple. It keeps you from ‚Ä¶ Heaven. It keeps
you from ‚Ä¶ the power to effectively deal, with complete
responsibility.</p>

<p>Joy. For those of you that were with us last week, do you remember what
that felt like last week? Joy. Did you practice evoking that in yourself
in the week that followed? Or did you only think of it as a memory and
go,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, that was nice. I hope we can do that again.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah. Hmm. Do you see how that pattern in the mind is the very pattern
that must become disciplined? If you truly loved yourself, your desire
to drink in joy would become constant and primary, and you simply would
not tolerate in yourself any willingness to make any other choice, no
matter what. Talk about an addictive drug. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúno‚Äù to it, say
‚Äúyes‚Äù ‚Ä¶ say ‚Äúyes.‚Äù</p>

<p>I want you so badly to come to where I am. I want you so badly to give
up your dreams of suffering and pain and lack. I want you so much to
realize the Love the Father has for you, that is poured forth and shaken
down around you so thoroughly that you can‚Äôt even comprehend it. The
mind could never comprehend the Love of God‚Äîbut the heart can become an
open valve through which it can flow.</p>

<p>Your life is worthy of reconstruction if that is what you desire. And I
say this unto you, and those of you that have perhaps studied my <em>Course
in Miracles</em>, rest assured that if you are truly getting it, if the
atonement is beginning to stir within you, you are going to eventually
have to come to face the fact that peace isn‚Äôt just mental gymnastics.
The healing of the mind must necessarily affect the healing of how you
are in the world, that changes how you are in the world; it must. And if
that is occurring within you, certain things that you may have
constructed in your life are going to start to feel like a prison to
you.</p>

<p>Now, what happens is that the mind says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, it‚Äôs reality so I‚Äôll conform myself to it,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>instead of letting your joy and your peace and your love burst the walls
of it, so that you can grow into something higher, more radiant; so that
more and more Light can be entrusted to you to flow through you.</p>

<p>In short, what I am talking about here is, don‚Äôt fool yourself. Don‚Äôt
rationalize it away. Face it head on and admit it. If there is some
aspect of your life that is not working, get straight with yourself.
Nobody is doing it but you. And all around you is the power to effect
change, because the power is within you.</p>

<p>What is one of the simplest ways of knowing whether or not you are
allowing yourself to flow with joy, your heart‚Äôs desires‚Äînot the ego‚Äôs
desires‚Äîthe heart‚Äôs desires?</p>

<p><em>If you feel frustration or limitation in any aspect of your life, it
means that there is something yet within your perceptions that you have
been fearful of turning to look at head on. And until you do so, you
will never heal it. Never.</em></p>

<p>The same limitation will be made manifest to you in another thousand
lifetimes. That‚Äôs just the way it is.</p>

<p>Of course, the mind says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Who thought up this game? That doesn‚Äôt sound like fun to me. Can‚Äôt
there be another way out?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, <em>you</em> created the game. You are the Milton Bradleys of creation.
Life is one great big Monopoly game. You designed it. You bought and
constructed the house in which you live, and that house is your mind.
And its foundation is the amount of joy you are willing to open yourself
up to and the degree to which you are willing to let that joy pour forth
through your life to burst out through the limitations that you might
experience‚Äîuntil your joy so far outshines the world that finally the
perception is healed. The light goes on and you realize,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Wait a minute. This Monopoly game can‚Äôt contain my Light.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you will put away every last trace of need to try to conform
yourself to the physical world And then you will come to where I am and
abide in the unlimitedness given unto you in the very moment that our
Holy Father thought you into being, as a perfect image of Himself.</p>

<p>Become unlimited. Choose to become powerful and it will look differently
to everybody. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you are all going to become
billionaires and run for President on the Independent Party ticket. But
it does mean that you‚Äôll get straight with yourself and realize that
there is some friction causing unhappiness in your life. Then you know
there is a limit there, a limitation. You will turn and face it head on
and declare that you are no longer willing to tolerate it because it
does not befit the holy Son of God.</p>

<p><em>Honesty begets responsibility. The choice of responsibility begets
discipline, and discipline begets the return to joy. And joy completes
the atonement in you. Indeed</em>.</p>

<p>So I hope that in this brief hour so far I have perhaps been able to
shed light on a few things, to give you a few thoughts to chew upon.</p>

<p>I mean what I said when I said that my way is easy and without effort.
The willingness to live an unlimited life filled with power and grace
and beauty and creativity and effectiveness, the willingness to learn,
to change whatever habits of perception and thought and behavior you are
carrying that are limiting you‚Äîthe choice to live that kind of life
really doesn‚Äôt require any effort. What requires effort is the
resistance to that life because it is a resistance to the overwhelming
river of joy that longs to pour forth through you, to rebirth you. Being
in the world is what takes effort. The mind has simply gotten it
confused.</p>

<p>So, cut loose and go for it. Cut loose and be willing to use each day to
face your limitations head on‚Äîto love them, to embrace them and to
transcend them. And you will know when you have transcended them because
they won‚Äôt emerge any longer; a simple law of creation. And remember,
it‚Äôs a law written on a card resting on a Monopoly board that you
created in your office and that you have sold to yourself‚Äî you‚Äôve made
up all the rules. Even the rules of mastery, and the mind has
conveniently laid them aside.</p>

<p>I call you this evening to join with me in, shall we say, a bit of a new
direction in our time together. I call you to join with me in learning
how to express the mastery that you are. All that has transpired and all
that we‚Äôve done to this point is to shake things up a bit and find out
who really wants to get on with it.</p>

<p>While I extend my love to everyone, I cannot force myself on any mind
and I cannot give what gifts I would bring to anybody who chooses not to
put them into action. And if you happen to have some friends who love to
talk about unlimitedness and mastery, ask them if they are really ready
for it.</p>

<p>For what we are going to begin in this evening is, if you will, a
progressive experience of bringing mastery into manifestation. But it
will require your diligence and your complete commitment. It will
require that you support one another and love one another. It will
require that you set aside the whole of the world wherever you happen to
be and choose joy.</p>

<p>So, right now, in your own way go inside your own heart. Let the body
relax and just breathe into the heart, and when you are ready, ask
yourself with complete honesty,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Am I really willing to take the curriculum, now?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if as you seek to answer that question you see fears come up, you
see questions come up that say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, if I could only look ahead I might be able to make a decision,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>rest assured that part of you really isn‚Äôt quite ready. And that‚Äôs okay.</p>

<p>The atonement requires finders and not seekers. The healing of mankind
requires finders and not seekers. It requires masters. Not those who
say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Well, gee, I‚Äôd like to master it all, but, gosh, I have so many other
things to do.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those other things are there because you have resisted your own mastery
to some degree and in some way.</p>

<p>To borrow a phrase that recently came into the mind of my beloved
brother: <em>When you are willing to learn what you know you don‚Äôt yet
know, mastery is only a blink away.</em></p>

<p>Interesting thought, don‚Äôt you think?</p>

<p>And take it another step further: when you are willing to learn what you
couldn‚Äôt even possibly learn that you don‚Äôt know . . . that is called
willingness.</p>

<p>Now in your language that sounds a little funny, but the same thing was
posed to me by the one who was my father. He put his hand on my shoulder
and said.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Son, you‚Äôve picked an interesting one. Quite a drama that you have
scripted.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I looked at him and said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What are you talking about?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Oh, I think you‚Äôll discover what I‚Äôm talking about. All in good
time.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in his own way he asked me the same question,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Are you willing to admit that there just might be something that you
don‚Äôt know and you don‚Äôt even know that you don‚Äôt know it? Are you
willing to learn?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And something in me, God only knows what, said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Yes I am.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that made all the difference in my own life and the completion of
the atonement within me. And I like to think it‚Äôs made some difference
in the world. Just as your choice will make all the difference in the
completion of your own atonement and, therefore, will also make a
difference in the world. Hmm.</p>

<p>Well, that was fun. How are you all doing?</p>

<p>Fine. Great.</p>

<p>Has any of this made a bit of sense?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Look around you for a moment . . . fellow travelers, desirous of
mastering the only curriculum that needs to be learned. There are many
ways to approach it, but until you accept that to learn that curriculum
<em>must mean that the structure of your life around</em> <em>you becomes wholly
and radically changed</em>‚Äîand that will mean something different to each of
you even now‚Äîyou really haven‚Äôt quite yet been willing to learn the
curriculum, no matter how many texts you‚Äôve read. No matter how many
verses you‚Äôve memorized. No matter how many prayers you‚Äôve said. Some
part of you has not quite been willing to become vulnerable. And yes, I
would tell the Pope the same thing. Hmm.</p>

<p>Jeshua, how do you make yourself vulnerable?</p>

<p>How do you make yourself vulnerable?</p>

<p>Choosing joy?</p>

<p>But remember, Firewalker, it‚Äôs not just thought. It is a feeling of
power that literally wells up, vibrates the cells of the body so you
can‚Äôt contain it. It‚Äôs not quite the same thing as what you experience
as ecstatic happiness that seems to take you to a crescendo and then
you‚Äôre burned out afterward. That‚Äôs not quite what I am talking about.
This joy is a frequency that you can feel vibrating, and it can become
constant and you can learn to master it so that you walk around, albeit
a few inches off the ground, and you‚Äôll find that you will be able to
function even in that frequency. Certain things begin to emerge within
that frequency. Your ability, for instance, to be in this world and yet
be totally with me, in total communication with me or any master you
want to be, becomes available‚Äîno separation between you and myself
whatsoever. The ability to tune in to see how your friends are doing on
the other side of the planet and to know what they are doing‚Äîall becomes
very natural. Where to go, who to talk to; it all becomes an effortless
flow.</p>

<p>Joy is like a fire and a frequency that burns off all of the cobwebs,
gets rid of all of the static, clarifies the Mind of Christ. And if you
don‚Äôt feel it down to the cells of your body, you don‚Äôt know yet what it
is.</p>

<p>Does that help a little bit?</p>

<p>It helps‚Ä¶ So at first the idea comes to the mind, ‚ÄúI choose joy‚Äù or ‚ÄúI
choose to come from Love.‚Äù But the body isn‚Äôt healing yet, or whatever
is going on is a heaviness. My mind will actually makes that statement,
‚ÄúI and my Father are one.‚Äù Then, what‚Äôs the next step after the
statement is made? The desire is there but the body is feeling heavy,
whatever the reason.</p>

<p>What is the reason?</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is because I don‚Äôt want it. For some
reason I don‚Äôt want it and I‚Äôm blocking it. I am scared of it at some
level.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs what I was talking about earlier. That fear gets projected
outside of yourself. You become fragmented, thinking the thing you fear
is something outside of you. The fear is what is within you.</p>

<p>The next step beyond the words‚Äîand I‚Äôve given you many, many cues‚Äîis to
become outrageous; play and sing and dance. Get a new motion going in
the body. Get a little crazy. Do things you‚Äôve never done before.
Interrupt the patterns of the mind. Ask the Holy Father to overwhelm
you. It is fine and well and good to begin by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I and my Father are one. Isn‚Äôt that a great thought? But I‚Äôm
depressed.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now the next stage, Firewalker, is to learn to find ways to evoke joy
even in the body. You know some ways, but I am talking about some others
here in which you truly begin to create a frequency, and we are going to
do a little bit of that in a few moments. But it must be <em>felt</em>. It must
get to the point where you can turn the frequency on, no matter what.</p>

<p>Know you that which is Reiki or the hands-on healing? It‚Äôs just a
dimension of letting some rays of joy enter the field of another‚Äôs mind.
They think it‚Äôs entering their body. It just enters the mind. The body
follows suit. You‚Äôve already allowed it to enter the field of the mind,
but you are keeping the trapdoor closed if it doesn‚Äôt pour forth into
the cells of the body. Eventually, no matter what, you can turn it on
and you won‚Äôt turn it off.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the next stage. And there is indeed, as you well know, a part of
you that‚Äôs a little reluctant to be overwhelmed with joy. A part of you
yet carries the sadness that you unwittingly yet identify with. Not as
much as in the past. It‚Äôs lessening, but it‚Äôs there. And so, when you
speak joyous words,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I and my Father are one. I choose love and not fear,</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>it‚Äôs almost like you tune into it up here [pointing to head] but there
is a heaviness down here [pointing to heart] and there seems to be a
gap between the two. What we are talking about now is really being
willing to close that gap. To erase what is down here that blocks that
downward descent of joy.</p>

<p>Indeed. So, Firewalker, are you ready to give it a shot?</p>

<p>Ready to go for it.</p>

<p>Fine. Come here. [The man comes in front of Jeshua.]</p>

<p>Why did you get out of your chair so slowly?</p>

<p>I have a sore back.</p>

<p>Ah. Now, what I want you to do is clap your hands three times as loudly
as you can.</p>

<p>[He claps.]</p>

<p>Get into it.</p>

<p>Now, pick what an old friend of mine would call a goddess. Pick a
goddess.</p>

<p>Now, dance. Get into it. Let‚Äôs go.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not a dancer.</p>

<p>Yes, you are. That‚Äôs a perception. [Addressing the others] Clap for
them. Let‚Äôs go. Come on.</p>

<p><em>[The group claps, and the two dance in the front of the room.]</em></p>

<p>Shout your joy, Firewalker. I don‚Äôt hear you. Shout your joy.</p>

<p>Joy! Joy! Joy! Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>[Clapping, dancing and shouting continue.]</p>

<p>Okay, all right. Now, thank your goddess.</p>

<p>Thank you, goddess.</p>

<p>You are welcome.</p>

<p>Now Firewalker, how did that feel?</p>

<p>A little spooky at first. A little fear came up. ‚ÄúAm I doing it right?‚Äù</p>

<p>Ah.</p>

<p>And then I got more response from people I felt saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù with me in
joy. It felt better and more at one with the group.</p>

<p>In other words, you felt safer.</p>

<p>I felt safer, yes. That‚Äôs a good way to put it.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a good way to put it. Now, listen. When I first asked you to
dance, what did you say?</p>

<p>In my mind? I don‚Äôt know.</p>

<p>Give him a moment here.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>I am asking them to give you a moment so that you can just rest and ask
yourself to look back to that moment, and what statement did you make?</p>

<p>To myself I said, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, or something like that. Some block came up. An
embarrassment or something.</p>

<p>What did he say?</p>

<p>‚ÄúI am not a dancer.‚Äù</p>

<p>You said, ‚ÄúI am not a dancer.‚Äù</p>

<p>Did I say that?</p>

<p>Oh my goodness where did that come from! That is what you said.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt even know I said that.</p>

<p>Now, this is very, very, very important, and once again this man,
Firewalker, has earned his nickname. Firewalker, do you see how I
created a set of circumstances that evoked an old perception that
expressed itself for this moment in the statement, ‚ÄúI am not a dancer?‚Äù
What the Son decrees is. You see, I pulled a little bit of a fast one on
you. You didn‚Äôt know what was coming so you couldn‚Äôt prepare, and the
Truth came up: the perception you hold, ‚ÄúI am not a dancer.‚Äù</p>

<p>Now, dancing isn‚Äôt just a god and a goddess shaking their bags of dust
around. Dancing is what life requires, you see. When you say, ‚ÄúI am not
a dancer,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with how you move your feet
and all of that. Nobody is holding a placard with the little numbers up
on them. Besides, God has a placard and He always gives you a ten. Do
you see what I am saying here?</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>It means that that perception, that‚Äôs the sadness inside. For you,
Firewalker, have carried that belief, ‚ÄúI am not a dancer.‚Äù And you are a
dancer. You just proved it. I thought he did rather well.</p>

<p>Yes. [Clapping.]</p>

<p>Indeed. Now, the dancing goddess. Did you enjoy it?</p>

<p>I fell a little self-conscious at first, but I got over it.</p>

<p>Exactly. Could you feel how his energy state changed? That is, as <em>he</em>
began to get into it, you also began to get into it.</p>

<p>Yes, it helped me.</p>

<p>Ah, there‚Äôs the key. Firewalker, you just extended love. You chose to
begin to set aside a perception that said, ‚ÄúI am not a dancer,‚Äù and yes,
it required the support of those who love you to give you the safety to
begin to relearn a different perception of yourself, and as you extended
that out, your frequency raised and it affected the frequency of the
goddess. That‚Äôs how love is extended, and that is what brings healing to
the world. Do you see?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Firewalker, are you willing to become a dancer?</p>

<p>Very much so.</p>

<p>Ah. It wasn‚Äôt so bad, was it? Now, I know some of you are going,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Boy, I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt pick on me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Laughter.]</p>

<p>When you can‚Äôt wait to get picked on, the end of the journey comes much
more quickly.</p>

<p>What I want to give unto you‚Äînow I‚Äôm not necessarily done for the
evening here, but I want to give unto you what you might call a bit of
homework.</p>

<p>Contemplate what just took place with Firewalker, and allow yourself
freedom, total safety, imagine that this group of friends is with you
all week long. Imagine yourself to rest in that safety just like
Firewalker did, and let yourself take a look within at the ways in your
own life at which you might be making the same statement to yourself,
the ways in any given day in which you refuse to be a dancer: the things
that seem to evoke fear, that depress you and conform you and close your
Light down. Allow yourself just to look at them. Not to make a judgment,
that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs about. The Holy Son of God is far beyond judgment.
But just look at it, and then choose one of those ways‚Äîand you‚Äôll find
more than just one that will pop up.</p>

<p>Within the next week‚Äôs time create a situation that seems to evoke that,
and make a different choice. Find a way to become a dancer in that
circumstance. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to necessarily stand at a
street corner and dance‚Äîalthough that‚Äôs a good one. Become creative at
looking at your life. It may be the way in which you try to communicate
to your spouse. It may be the way in which you refuse to take care of
yourself. And find a way to dance, a way that evokes the feeling of,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Yes, this is rather nice. I‚Äôm loving myself.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that is what Firewalker really just did. He loved himself enough
to dance. He said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The heck with the perception that seems to block me. I am going to
dance.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the day will come, you see, when Firewalker dances all the time and
he won‚Äôt really care if we are all around to support him in safety.
He‚Äôll dance no matter what the world says. And that is mastery and
freedom.</p>

<p>So, fair enough? Do you understand the assignment? Does it make sense to
everyone?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Indeed. So, Firewalker?</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for all your love and your teaching and your support.</p>

<p>Teaching and love and support are totally meaningless unless someone
receives it.</p>

<p>It is received.</p>

<p>Thank you, I know. Indeed.</p>

<p>Ah. So, you see, we are going to be having some assignments as we go
down the path. Some will seem to challenge you as you‚Äôve never been
challenged before‚Äîbut not until you are ready for them. That‚Äôs all you
need to do this week: become willing to look at the ways in your own
life that you are refusing to dance and find a way to make a different
choice.</p>

<p>It could be as simple as how you feel when you walk in the door of your
place of employment. You might choose to skip through the door, kiss
your little time card, smile at the supervisor and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What an incredible day.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may be something that simple, but you begin to interrupt what has
become a chronic and unwitting and unaware pattern in the mind, because
that unaware pattern is what has been telling you that the world out
there is really real. And it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs an illusion‚Äîit‚Äôs all done with
mirrors.</p>

<p>So. I indeed love you, and in you is the worthiness of the holy Son of
God to choose anew, to choose empowerment, to choose awakening‚Äîto find
the small and little ways, that perhaps seem big, in which you are yet
blocking that Light from flowing through your life. Will it feel like
dying? Oh, yes. Thank God for that. Death is the most incredibly
beautiful creation you have ever come up with. The death of the ego. The
death of the small self. The death of all illusion. Oh, my God, what a
beautiful and glorious sight. So go ahead and die a little this week
that the joy in you might become full and the life in you might shine
forth, and that life and that Light will be the means by which the
atonement is completed on Earth as it is in Heaven.</p>

<p>Be at peace in all things, and know . . . it‚Äôs not serious. Sing, laugh,
dance, play. Indeed.</p>

<p>Peace be unto you.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
