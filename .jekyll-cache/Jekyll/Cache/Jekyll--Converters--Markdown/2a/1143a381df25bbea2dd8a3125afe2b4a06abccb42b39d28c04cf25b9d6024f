<p>On the day of your crucifixion, it was told that you spoke the words,</p>

<p>“Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?”</p>

<p>Can you elaborate on that? Will you?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>

<p>That is always the proper question.</p>

<p>First, I have, indeed, given forth this answer to a certain one that
you’re aware of.</p>

<p>We would highly suggest that you merely obtain that answer, for it was
not given to be kept and held in privacy.</p>

<p>Now, we would amend it by saying that I’ve
felt guilty about that statement ever since. [Laughter]</p>

<p>Beloved friend, if I have not touched every kernel of humanity and the
experience of it that you have known, it is useless for you to listen to
me.</p>

<p>And I have nothing to offer you.</p>

<p>It is a very good question, but in the end, bring it around a little
further and ask of <em>yourself</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why have I said, “Father, why have you forsaken me?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something to be pondered.</p>
