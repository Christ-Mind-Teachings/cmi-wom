  August 17, 1988
</p>

<p><span class="capital">â€œI</span> just got a call from Wayne.â€</p>

<p>I put the last touches on the flow chart Iâ€™ve been designing; hit the F7
key to save the document, then turn in my chair to look at Geoff. â€œYou
what?â€</p>

<p>â€œI just got a call from Wayne.â€ Geoff is not smiling. In fact, a look
bordering on pain is etched into his face. He glances at me, then at the
floor. This does not feel good.</p>

<p>â€œWhat is going on these days back in Columbus?â€ I ask, referring to the
headquarters of the software company that we work for. It has been a
very satisfying relationship, and the future is bright.</p>

<p>Geoff turns his head away and looks out the window. Whatever it is, he
certainly does not want to say it. â€œWayne just told me that our
paychecks might bounce.â€</p>

<p>â€œCome again?â€ I am sure I did not hear what I heard.</p>

<p>â€œHe said our paychecks might bounce.â€ Now Terry, our service technician,
his ears perked by Geoffâ€™s words, bounds into my office with an
inquisitive look of disbelief.</p>

<p>Geoff continues. â€œDamn! There are apparently some big problems with
money right now. I donâ€™t know what is going on. Wayne may be the
vice-president, but he doesnâ€™t seem to know much himself. <em>Something</em> is
hitting the fan back there.â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat money problems?!â€ I interject. â€œWe have done <br />$150,000 in business
the last two months, and they canâ€™t make salaries?â€</p>

<p>Geoff winces. â€œI know, I know. Right now, I do not know what else to
tell you. Damn!â€ His frustration explodes as he slams his fist into the
wall, then takes a deep breath and sighs.</p>

<p>All three of us are on the phones to our banks, and the replies are the
same. Our paychecks have bounced.</p>

<p>Frustration, anger, fear, confusion, and a sense of disorientation run
rampant for the next several minutes. Finally we get through to Wayne,
all three of us speaking at the same time from our individual office
phones, until Wayne shouts for silence.</p>

<p>â€œLook! I am as much caught by this as you guys are. We <em>thought</em> we had
<br />$200,000 in backing from our financiers, and so weâ€™ve been leveraging
our assets to expand our markets, like yours out there in Washington.
But itâ€™s been withdrawn. Maybe it wasnâ€™t there, I donâ€™t know. The bank
has frozen our assets. There is no money available.â€</p>

<p>The reality is beginning to sink in. It occurs to me to ask about the
commissions, especially the development fees due to us for the software
products we had designed for the company. An amount of <br />$10,000 is due
to us in only 45 days.</p>

<p>After a long pause, Wayne speaks slowly. â€œIt looks like <em>all</em> of it is
history, Marc.â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat about the checks due in a week for the month of August?â€</p>

<p>Silence is the only answer any of us needs to hear.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, it hits me full force. I have lost two monthsâ€™
salary, an additional few thousand in commissions, and - most
significantly - my share of the development fees due on October 1st.
<em>That</em> money is what I had joined this venture for. Even conservative
royalty estimates had promised enough income to allow me to stop working
every day in order to get to the next.</p>

<p>Then a paralyzing fear grips me. When all is said and done, I have
enough funds to live through the month of October. And thatâ€™s it.</p>

<p>I finally raise my eyes from my financial records and stare out the
window at blackness, seeing only my own reflection blankly staring back.
Much time passes this way, simply staring as if transfixed at - and
through - this transparent image of myself.</p>

<p>Thoughts begin to whirl, chasing each other round and around, visions of
what would have been, visions of what I had expected, visions of
imagined disasters yet to befall me, all of them whirling around a
central axis of Wayneâ€™s one message to us: â€œThere is no money.â€</p>

<p>But now, something shifts. The image and racing thoughts dissolve,
replaced by feelings, energy pulsating through me. I feel it first in my
solar plexus, then building and pushing through my chest. I
involuntarily begin to breathe very deeply, and the energy continues
moving upward. Its quality is transformed as it seems to fill my head
now, and suddenly I burst out laughing. God, I am laughing as I have not
laughed in years, maybe never! It is not the laughter of nervousness,
nor of helplessness. It is the laughter of freedom!</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t lost anything. No job has been lost, no royalties, no
commissions - nothing. What has been lost is a weight, the weight of
believing that I must strive to get ahead, to gain something I thought I
did not have. No, nothing of any importance has been lost. The only
thing that has happened is that a bubble has burst.</p>

<p>And as that realization sinks in, the phone rings.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>â€œHello?â€</p>

<p>â€œHi, itâ€™s Kendra. I know this is probably going to sound weird, but is
everything all right?â€</p>

<p>Struck by the uncanny timing of her call, as well as her question, I do
not answer immediately, and so she continues. â€œI was getting ready for
bed, and suddenly I had this overwhelming urge to call you and, well,
for a moment I was actually a little frightened. Pretty crazy, huh?â€</p>

<p>What strikes me is that too few of us trust our intuition enough to act
on it, as she has done. Sitting in the hard-backed chair next to the
phone, I tell her all that happened today.</p>

<p>â€œGod, that is scary! I donâ€™t know what I would do!â€ And, then, more
softly, â€œWhat <em>are</em> you going to do?â€</p>

<p>I pause, realizing I had not really thought about it, yet my answer
comes quickly. â€œWell, I have my yoga classes which begin again soon.
Maybe Iâ€™ll expand them, maybe even get busy and do some promotional
work. And, well, I am going to write.â€</p>

<p>The cat is out of the bag.</p>

<p>â€œJust what are you going to write?â€ Her voice betrays her suspicion that
she already knows the answer.</p>

<p>â€œIt feels like it is time to startâ€¦ I mean, I am sitting here with no
money to speak of, no idea what The Jeshua Letters is supposed to be. I
feel like I am staring into a fog that obscures everything in front of
me, yet I have the oddest feeling that the fog is utterly safe.â€</p>

<p>Kendra asks the obvious. â€œHow are you going to make it?â€</p>

<p>â€œThat is the strangest part. At least, it seems strange to me. It seems
so clear - at the moment - that all these years I have believed there is
some sort of security out there in the world, and now it is like waking
up from a dream or something. My rational mind wants to insist that this
is just a momentary setback, and that I should start scrambling around
again to create that security. But a deeper part of me seems to know
there is no need, no purpose, in pursuing that course any more.â€</p>

<p>â€œAre you okay with that?â€</p>

<p>I sigh, and Kendra is quiet, allowing me time to sort out my feelings.
â€œYes. Well, no. Well, I know it doesnâ€™t make sense, and yet in that
moment when the bubble burst - it somehow made perfect sense. It feels,
well, like it is what I am supposed to be doing. It is that deeper
<em>feeling</em> that overrides my reasoning mind shouting thoughts of fear and
panic.â€</p>

<p>Again, there is a long pause, as Kendra gives me room to continue my
sorting.</p>

<p>â€œI donâ€™t know. Maybe Iâ€™m crazy. I guess the worst thing that can happen
to me is that Iâ€™ll end up a bag lady.â€</p>

<p>â€œA bag lady?â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah. I figure Iâ€™ll have to wear a disguise so no one will see how
embarrassed I am.â€ We both laugh for a moment, then become silent again.</p>

<p>â€œKendra, this is really affecting me. I mean, something is affecting me.
This is not me, you know? I have no money to speak of, no job. Iâ€™m going
through emotions over everything that happened so suddenly, like the rug
just got swept out from under me. And yet beneath it all is this hidden,
quiet sense of rightness. Like all of it is <em>all right</em>. Everything that
happened, and everything that will happen.</p>

<p>â€œIt confounds me, actually. Sometimes the rational voice within me
becomes so loud that it seems to win me over, and I feel certain I am
totally out to lunch, that I had better get my head back down into
reality. But then that quiet, peaceful feeling re-emerges, and I feel
very certain that what I am saying to you is what I am going to do. I am
going to write the book.â€</p>

<p>Again, there is a pause.</p>

<p>â€œSo,â€ Kendra finally speaks, nearly at a whisper, â€œitâ€™s happening. I
mean, it is actually <em>unfolding</em>.â€</p>

<p>â€œRemember Castanedaâ€™s books?â€ I ask, knowing that they are among her
favorites: â€œRemember when Carlos has to jump off the cliff into the
black of night? Well, I feel like I have jumped without knowing I did
so. Most of the time, it feels okay. But at other times I start kicking
and screaming, even though I keep falling. And the falling feels
absolutely right, no matter how strong my anxiety attacks are. It feels
like it is happening in slow motion, yet I know that it is happening
now, even as I speak with you.â€</p>

<p>Hearing my own words magnifies the reality of it all. I <em>have</em> jumped off
the cliff, one I never thought I would consider going near. I am going
to make <em>The Jeshua Letters</em> public, and let come what may.</p>

<p>â€œWhen do I get to read it?â€ Kendra asks.</p>

<p>My reply comes so quickly that the words seem to rumble out even before
I can think them. â€œThe manuscript will be done around Christmas, and
Iâ€™ll circulate a few copies among friends before I set about finding a
way to publish it.â€</p>

<p>By Christmas?! I havenâ€™t even started transcribing the communications
yet, nor do I have any idea what to do with them! Am I getting a taste
of what it means to jump off the cliff?</p>

<p>â€œKendra?â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah?â€</p>

<p>â€œMind if I share with you something really strange?â€</p>

<p>She laughs, and her response to me is almost giddy.</p>

<p>â€œYou mean all of this isnâ€™t strange enough?â€</p>

<p>â€œKendra, during the past few weeks, sometimes in meditation, sometimes
just doing whatever, an image of a woman has appeared in my mind. With
it, Jeshua has suggested that I go see this woman. At first, I was at a
loss, yet I felt I <em>knew</em> her, even though it isnâ€™t someone I have ever
met.</p>

<p>â€œWell, last week I suddenly remembered an old business associate who
told me about a Christian mystic in Seattle he was quite fond of. It
struck me deeply because he said that she â€˜speaks with Jesusâ€™.</p>

<p>â€œAnyway, I got her name and number, and gave her office a call. Iâ€™m
scheduled to meet with her tomorrow. When I made the appointment, I had
no idea how I would be able to get away from work. Surprise, surprise!â€</p>

<p>Our conversation ends with Kendraâ€™s unconditional support, together with
her insistence that I tell her everything that happens when I meet with
â€œthat mystic lady.â€</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>I am still fifteen minutes early, so I drive slowly by the stately old
mansion - now named Gethsemane - which is both home and teaching center
for Elizabeth Burrows. The box containing the communications is on the
seat beside me, but it occurs to me not to show this to her. I do not so
much want to talk about my experience as hear about hers. Iâ€™ll just stay
in the closet for now, thank you.</p>

<p>Turning around a few blocks away, I return and park the car,
acknowledging my nervousness as I climb the steps and open the leaded
glass door. Why am I here? â€œJust go with the flow, Marc, just go with
the flow. Trust, remember?â€ I think to myself, trying to relax, to slow
my breath.</p>

<p>Ms. Burrowsâ€™ personal secretary greets me warmly and escorts me upstairs
to the mystic ladyâ€™s office. I hear her secretary announce me and, as
she steps aside, I see Elizabeth standing up - all five feet four inches
of her - face beaming in a large smile, hand extended warmly. We are
already as old friends - at least, it feels like it to me.</p>

<p>Her hair is cropped short, and she is dressed completely in white.
Apparently hearing my unasked question, she explains: â€œI choose to wear
white, you see, as it is the clothing worn by the Essenes, of which I
was one, at the time of the Master.â€</p>

<p>We fall easily into an intriguing conversation, talking about
metaphysics, yoga, cosmic consciousness, her memories of life as an
Essene, and her love for the Master, the one named Jesus. She is
obviously very intelligent and well studied, and she speaks from
personal experience about mystical states of awareness. In fact, she
speaks of these things easily, as I might talk about the weather or a
favorite restaurant.</p>

<p>â€œElizabeth,â€ I interject, â€œI recently had an experience I would like to
ask you about.â€</p>

<p>Now I know why I left the communications in the box. I will not mention
his name.</p>

<p>â€œI was sitting in meditation one day, when a being seemed to appear out
of a field of golden lightâ€¦â€</p>

<p>I do not need to continue. A smile crosses her face; her eyes look not
so much at me as through me, toward something, or someone who elicits a
gentle joy, a love, a reverence, from her.</p>

<p>â€œThatâ€™s Him.â€</p>

<p>â€œHim?â€ I ask.</p>

<p>â€œOh, I mean â€˜He.â€™â€</p>

<p>â€œNo, I am certainly not correcting your English, but who is â€˜Himâ€™?â€</p>

<p>She looks directly at me, and says, â€œWhy, the Master Jesus, of course,â€
implying with her tone that I obviously knew it.</p>

<p>There is silence for a long moment, her eyes embracing me, and then she
speaks. â€œI know now why you are here. There is something you are
missing. Something He wants you to have. Please, follow me.â€</p>

<p>Like a dutiful and innocent child, I do so, following her down the
stairway, my hand gently running along the top of the polished, wooden
handrail. At the bottom of the stairs we turn and enter the library.</p>

<p>After looking through the bookshelves for a few moments, she picks out
two volumes; one small and very thin, the other much larger and thicker.
â€œHere we are,â€ she says, handing them to me. â€œOur time together is now
completed. Iâ€™ll leave you to show yourself out.â€</p>

<p>Her departure catches me a bit by surprise, and after a moment I look
down at books I have never seen before, even after twenty years of
extensive study. The tiny book is entitled <em>The Discovery of the Essene
Gospel of Peace</em>, the larger one is a rendition of the <em>Gospel of Peace</em>
written by Elizabeth. Electricity is running through my fingertips and
up into my arms.</p>

<p>I know it is time to leave, and I do so, holding the volumes to my
chest, which feels warmer and warmer. All the way back to Tacoma, there
is an unmistakable feeling of joy. Occasionally I reach down, letting my
hand rest on the books, caressing them, smiling.</p>

<p class="center">EVERYTHING IS AS IT SHOULD BE. TRUST.</p>

<p>Back in my apartment, I sit down in the living room, bathed in serene
afternoon sunlight filtering through the blinds, books on my lap. Again,
I run my hands over them, pulse quickening. She was right. These are
what I was sent for. I know it without even reading them!</p>

<p>Not hurrying, savoring this experience of clarity, I open the larger
book, and as I read, tears begin to come - tears of joy, tears of
recognition. Beyond even the slightest trace of doubt, I know I am
reading the teachings of the Master, of Jesus, of Jeshua.</p>

<p>A tremendous burst of energy moves rapidly up my spine, exploding in a
flood of images, scenes, memories of another life - a life that is
surely mine. As the images flow through me, felt in every cell, my tears
flow freely, releasing a deep tension that has unwittingly held back the
memories. The tears simultaneously seem to flood me, nurture me, and
bathe me in a joy beyond words.</p>

<p>For a moment, I see with my mindâ€™s eye the face of Jonah, and recognize
the identity of the â€œGreat One.â€ My teacher, my friend, my guru: Jeshua,
the one called Jesus.</p>

  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>Again,<br />
you have chosen to prepare a place for Me,<br />
and so I come now unto you.</p>

  <p>Beloved,<br />
is it not without effort that<br />
the Kingdom is entered?<br />
What struggle must be experienced,<br />
what obstacle overcome?<br />
Is not such perception founded on the belief<br />
that illusion is Reality?</p>

  <p>Never are you separate<br />
from your Holy Father.<br />
You simply choose to insist that you are.<br />
Herein is the birth<br />
and continuance<br />
of all struggle,<br />
all fear,<br />
all doubt.<br />
Penetrate this truth wholly,<br />
and illusion will be no more.<br />
Shall we tarry longer?</p>

  <p>The Father awaits<br />
the return of the Son,<br />
with patience born<br />
of incomprehensible love.</p>

  <p>There are no wrong turns in your journey,<br />
nor in anyoneâ€™s.<br />
You know this is madness to the world,<br />
but the world is madness.<br />
Release it.</p>

  <p>This day I shall speak only briefly,<br />
for what needs to be shared is simple.<br />
I await you just beyond the edge<br />
of your resistance to a purpose<br />
freely given,<br />
and accepted.<br />
I AM the end of your pain,<br />
which the journey of Separation is.<br />
You are but a breath away now,<br />
yet your resistance is your path<br />
to the abode of the Father.</p>

  <p>Embrace every moment of your experience wholly.<br />
Celebrate it.<br />
This will quicken the process<br />
of final release.</p>

  <p><strong>The Jeshua Letters</strong> is the beginning<br />
of our work together;<br />
your purpose is to allow it<br />
into the fabric of illusion<br />
which traps the Fatherâ€™s Son.<br />
It is the creation of another door<br />
leading from illusion to Reality.</p>

  <p>Enlightenment is inevitable.<br />
Remember this always<br />
as you gaze upon your fellow dreamers.<br />
Serving the Atonement<br />
is to know the effortless joy<br />
of the Fatherâ€™s will.<br />
All else is but resistance to this.</p>

  <p>I am always here,<br />
and will participate with you<br />
in this most joyous work<br />
of atoning the momentary imagination<br />
of Separation<br />
whenever you choose to recognize Me,<br />
instead of the world.</p>

  <p>Peace unto you.</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>

</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>Beloved brethren,<br />
I would ask that you pause<br />
in the movement of your dream,<br />
that I might share with you this moment.</p>

  <p>I am not lost to you,<br />
and I assure you that<br />
you are not lost to Me.<br />
â€œLift up a rock, and there<br />
you shall find Me also.â€<br />
How long will you choose to wait<br />
for what is necessarily inevitable?<br />
The Dreamer will, indeed, awaken.</p>

  <p>To see with new eyes<br />
is to transform the world,<br />
which is entirely of your making,<br />
from a world of darkness<br />
into a world of Light.</p>

  <p>To see with new eyes<br />
requires only that you abandon<br />
those perceptions which already<br />
you know cannot work.<br />
The Kingdom you seek<br />
cannot be found where you are.<br />
It is, however,<br />
where I AM.<br />
The distance between us is never<br />
more than this simple choice:<br />
to release your insane insistence<br />
on separation from your Holy Father.</p>

  <p>I am Jeshua.<br />
I am available to you whenever<br />
you decide to choose<br />
to know Me.<br />
There is not the least difficulty in this,<br />
for it is simply to choose<br />
to truly be who you already are,<br />
and have forgotten.<br />
As you come to know Me,<br />
the recognition will dawn that what I AM<br />
exists everywhere<br />
as the substance of all things.</p>

  <p>As you come to know Me,<br />
the recognition will dawn<br />
that you are already all<br />
that I represent<br />
to the consciousness of humanity.<br />
As you come to know Me,<br />
the recognition will dawn that<br />
there is no distance to travel,<br />
no growth to occur, no error to correct,<br />
save one:<br />
your insane perception of yourself<br />
as separate from Me.</p>

  <p>You are as a rich man<br />
who travels forth with a purse<br />
of jewels and gold coins,<br />
searching constantly for the treasure<br />
he is certain is there for him,<br />
forgetting the purse clutched<br />
tightly in his hands.</p>

  <p>Consider this image,<br />
and allow it to transform your perception,<br />
for this is a very accurate image<br />
of what you have <strong>chosen</strong> to be.<br />
You are entirely free to make your choice anew.</p>

  <p>Remember always that the<br />
truth of the Kingdom is utterly beyond<br />
the capacity of your world.</p>

  <p>Therefore,<br />
seek not guidance from the world,<br />
for it cannot lead you<br />
to what lies beyond the world:<br />
the Kingdom,<br />
and the treasure you seek<br />
in all your longings.<br />
I am with you always,<br />
though rarely do you recognize Me.<br />
I am the very heart of what you are,<br />
always,<br />
though you struggle to deny it.</p>

  <p>When you release your Dream -<br />
which is wholly insane -<br />
the Reality of who you are<br />
will alone remain.</p>

  <p>Herein lies the end<br />
of your travel.<br />
Herein lies peace.<br />
Herein, I AM.<br />
Come home to Me.<br />
Come home to your true Self,<br />
and celebrate with Me this one fact:<br />
â€œI and My Father are One.â€</p>

  <p>Peace be unto you,<br />
My beloved brethren.<br />
Not as the world gives,<br />
give I unto you.<br />
Yet My giving is but<br />
<strong>your</strong> giving to yourself.</p>

  <p>When will you choose to accept it?</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>Now, we begin.</p>

  <p>It is not without much hesitation<br />
that I come forth unto you<br />
at this time.<br />
This hesitation occurs because<br />
there is again a resistance building within you,<br />
though at very subtle levels.</p>

  <p>During this pivotal transformation<br />
you are moving closer than ever before<br />
to dissolution in Me.<br />
It is a time of critical importance,<br />
for the ego -<br />
the habit of separation -<br />
will rise yet more steadfastly<br />
to block this from occurring.<br />
To the conscious mind it <strong>appears</strong><br />
that all is well,<br />
but at very refined,<br />
very deep levels,<br />
I assure you that it is not.</p>

  <p>Therefore,<br />
I hesitated to come forth,<br />
for it was possible that the resistance<br />
would again be your habitual choice,<br />
thus rebuilding the wall we have<br />
worked so diligently to dismantle.</p>

  <p>I am pleased that -<br />
in a very critical moment of this contact -<br />
you chose in your soul to open to Me.<br />
lt was at this point that<br />
the clear vision of Light appeared to you,<br />
and you beheld various images<br />
granting recognition of My presence.</p>

  <p>You are very much like a warrior<br />
engaged in your last battle.<br />
The â€œenemiesâ€ take on subtler form,<br />
and can therefore go unnoticed.<br />
It was I who spoke to you this morning,<br />
suggesting you arise.<br />
It is a great truth that receptivity to guidance<br />
is most present during the time<br />
of the early morning.<br />
A touch of sleepiness,<br />
I might add,<br />
enhances the receptivity.</p>

  <p>Come into the mountains tomorrow.<br />
Do not allow the â€œshouldsâ€<br />
of your illusion to take precedence.<br />
The emotions you have been feeling -<br />
beginning last evening<br />
are the result of your denial of Me.<br />
This you well know.</p>

  <p>You have chosen to participate<br />
in the bringing forth<br />
of a knowledge so sublime,<br />
so simple,<br />
as to seem ungraspable.<br />
It is the knowledge of living in Christ <strong>wholly</strong>.</p>

  <p>Again,<br />
I reiterate that this<br />
is a crucial time for you.<br />
Let not your path be shaken.<br />
All the universe moves to support you at this time,<br />
as it does whenever -<br />
and wherever -<br />
a soul stands on the brink<br />
of fully awakening.</p>

  <p>Do not allow your habit -<br />
born of Separation -<br />
force yet another denial of this support.<br />
To the degree you allow support,<br />
support is given.<br />
This is the bounty of your Fatherâ€™s table.</p>

  <p>This communication brings forth no new teaching.<br />
What has been given forth as <strong>The Jeshua Letters</strong><br />
is now finished.<br />
The completion of this project is inevitable now.<br />
Following this shall come<br />
specific guidance from us,<br />
and I shall continue to refine this Teaching as required,<br />
for the benefit of the many levels<br />
of human consciousness.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow,<br />
when you journey to your mountains,<br />
you will establish contact<br />
with an entity -<br />
a soul -<br />
who will begin to give forth to you<br />
the wisdom of the earth,<br />
which you have asked for.</p>

  <p>Marc,<br />
I well perceive your incredulity.<br />
â€œGod, another one!?â€ you think to yourself.<br />
Is it not time to simply<br />
be what you have chosen:<br />
a messenger of the heart,<br />
opening, receiving, and sharing<br />
the wisdom of perfect knowledge<br />
to assist in the awakening of man?</p>

  <p>This is not a grand thing,<br />
but the simplest of the simple:<br />
the inevitable conclusion to the drama<br />
of Separation,<br />
for Light cannot be ultimately denied.</p>

  <p>Soon now,<br />
the consciousness of man<br />
will bask in the glory of the Sonâ€™s remembrance</p>

  <p>Rejoice,<br />
and allow your return to Light<br />
to be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>Amen.</p>

<p>I manage to get to Kendraâ€™s just as she is pulling out of her driveway
for the one-hour ritual drive to work.</p>

<p>â€œTake a moment and read this, will you?â€ I hand her the communication,
and, for a moment, she looks at me with an unspoken question in her
eyes. She probably isnâ€™t used to having people pull into her driveway at
7:30 in the morning insisting that she stop to read things like this.
She shivers suddenly. As she finishes reading, she hands it back to me,
and I detect a trace of tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s finished,â€ she says with quiet resolution. â€œYou know, I didnâ€™t
shiver because Iâ€™m cold.â€</p>

<p>â€œI know.â€</p>

<p>She turns and walks back to her car, slides in, closes the door, and
rolls the window down. â€œSo, what are you going to do now?â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, it seems I am in quite a spot, arenâ€™t I?â€</p>

<p>Her face is quizzical. â€œWhat do you mean?â€</p>

<p>â€œKendra, the only way I will ever know if any of this is valid is to do
it, all of it. Not just write the book, but strive to live it. Only,
what Jeshua talks about doesnâ€™t seem to be the kind of thing one can
learn to do. It seems you either choose to be it, or you donâ€™t.â€</p>

<p>She nods her head, looking at the dashboard. â€œI know. I think,
sometimes, we <em>all</em> know it.â€ Lifting her head, she gazes out through the
windshield, her eyes focused on nothing in particular.</p>

<p>â€œYes, I think we all know it. But living it seems to be another matter.â€</p>

<p>Now she looks back at me. â€œI suppose I better get on to work, or is it
back to my dream? So, what are you up to for the rest of the day?â€</p>

<p>It had been my intention to spend the day looking for work. I guess my
rational side had been winning the battle. I shrug my shoulders and
smile. â€œIâ€™m going to the mountains.â€</p>
