I"°¨<p>Now, we begin.</p>

<p>And once again, greetings unto you, beloved and holy friends. Once
again, it is with great joy that we come forth to abide with you in this
manner. It is with great joy that I come forth with my friends to abide
with you in this hour. It is with great joy that I walk with you on the
way that you have chosen. For in Truth, there is not a time that I am
not with you. There is not a place to which you can journey where you
will not discover my presence.</p>

<p>Only reality can be true. And reality is simple: there is but the
simplicity of Love. And from that ocean there is birthed a multitude of
forms, a multitude of worlds, a multitude of creations, of which you are
one. And like waves arising from the sea, those creations remain linked
eternally to their Creator. You are a wave arising from the Infinite
Ocean of the Love which is the presence of God. I am a wave that has
arisen from the ocean of my Father‚Äôs Holy Mind. And though two waves
seem to appear separated by what is called time ‚Äî by even two thousand
of your years ‚Äî yet, in Truth, when seen from a much broader
perspective, those waves have arisen simultaneously from the Ocean‚Äôs
surface. They arise for the very same purpose: to express the
simplicity, and the innocence, and the beauty, the creativity, the
truth, and the reality of the Ocean Itself.</p>

<p>And the waves delight in expressing what seems to be a unique
individuality. And yet, they carry the common thread of being made of
the same substance and are truly governed by the same Laws of Creation.
For they know not the moment of their own arising, for only the Depth of
the Ocean unseen can know the moment when It chooses to well up and to
create the expression of the wave. The power that is not seen, but is
hidden in the Depth of the Ocean, rises up through and forms that wave
and sustains that wave throughout the duration of its expression. And it
is from the Depth of that Ocean that it is decided when that wave shall
return to the sea. Does that mean it disappears? Only from one
perspective. But in reality, the very substance that was made manifest
truly has not known birth and death, but only expression.</p>

<p>What, then, if you were to consider yourself as a wave arising from the
Holy Mind of God, born of God‚Äôs infinite desire to expand Himself, to
express the infinite nature of Love and creativity? What if you began to
realize that all that you have called yourself is the effect of Love ‚Äî
that you do not cause yourself to come into existence? And yet, as you
have arisen from that Ocean of Love, is not the wave made of the same
substance as the sea itself? Are you not given infinite and perfect
freedom? For just as your Father perceives you, you are given the
freedom to perceive yourself, and all of the other waves you might
notice, and even the Ocean Itself, in any way that you choose.</p>

<p>The goal, then, of a genuine spirituality is to realign the quality of
your perception, to mirror, to resonate with, to be in perfect alignment
with the perception of your Creator; to see with God‚Äôs eyes. Beloved
friends, in Truth, you remain as you are created to be. And in each and
every moment, you are literally using the power, found in the silent
depth of the Ocean of God‚Äôs Love, that gave rise to your very creation
and existence, to <em>perceive</em> as you <em>desire</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, in this hour, we will address the very nature of <em>desire</em>
itself: what it means, what it signifies, how it creates effects, the
power of desire, the value of desire, the meaning and purpose of desire,
and how to begin to bring that energy (which at times, you know, feels
like a team of a thousand wild horses all wanting to go in their own
directions), to bring the very Power of Desire under your conscious and
deliberate direction, that you might, indeed, create as the Father
created you ‚Äî with perfect, deliberate, infinite Love, with perfect and
infinite and deliberate freedom, with perfect and infinite and
deliberate joy, and with perfect, <em>perfect</em>, freedom.</p>

<p>Desire! When I walked upon your planet as a man, I confronted many
different opinions about the nature of creation, the nature of mankind,
the nature of consciousness, although the word was not around at the
time ‚Äî what you call consciousness or self-identity. Just as you are now
confronted with many schools of thought, so, too, was I. And while that
can seem to lead to great confusion, as though one must choose from the
smorgasbord, it actually serves not unlike the sand inside the oyster
from which the pearl will come. It causes you to grate inside. <em>You must
find your own way to your own truth.</em> For before each and every one of
you lies your pathway and a doorway, an eye of the needle, through which
<em>only you</em> can fit.</p>

<p>Therefore, in some respects, you are seemingly alone. You must make the
decision to <em>desire, above all things, awakening into perfect remembrance
of your union with God</em> ‚Äî just as a wave might finally decide that it has
been birthed, not to be fearful of being a wave, but to truly claim its
individuation, to claim its uniqueness, and to live that fully. And in
that fullness, to decide to discover a way to be aware of its infinite
union with the ocean itself, to somehow break free of the myopic
self-identification as one little piece of wave that arises in a place
or a field of time, lasts for but a second and then disappears. To find
a way to transcend that limitation, to become re-identified with a
consciousness, a living awareness, that you are One with the Depth of
the Sea. That you can operate, not from the superficial level of
awareness that might be like the foam at the tip of the wave (what you
call your conscious or egoic mind), but that you become informed in all
that you speak, in all that you do, in all that you create, and all that
you perceive, by that which rests in the very Infinite Depth of the
Ocean Itself.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, drawing upon a well within you that seems to have no
bottom and sides, through which something is pouring forth from places
unseen, in which your literal conscious attention, your conscious
awareness, seems to be colored with Radiant Light that literally leaves
you feeling that you are <em>not</em> the body-mind or the personal history with
which you had identified before, but that these things are only
temporal, or temporary and very impersonal effects of a level of desire,
within your soul, which is one and the same thing as the Love of God
expressing Itself, for no other reason than that Love <em>must</em> be extended.</p>

<p>Imagine transcending your fear of your own survival, because as you look
upon your body-mind you are no longer identified as that body-mind; that
those things have become tools to be utilized by the Love which rests in
the Mind of God; that you live, yet no longer you, but Christ dwells <em>as</em>
you. <em>This is a very real experience to be lived.</em> It is not just a
philosophy. It is not just a concept, and it can never be a dogma. There
is a <em>mystical translation</em> that occurs in the depth of the soul which, in
Truth, is merely a <em>shifting</em> of where you perceive your sense and source
of identity. And the energy, the energy required to take you from myopic
self-contraction, in which you have become identified with the little
drops of foam out on the tip of the wave, tossed to and fro by a power
that seems to be outside of you, to a sense of identify with the Silent
Depth of the Ocean, that is everywhere present and seems to know no
beginning or no end, the very energy that will carry you from the tip of
the wave to the Depth of the Ocean, is the <em>energy of desire</em>.</p>

<p>For I say well unto you, that if the Father had not desired to extend
Love, you would never have come into existence. Your very sense of
awareness of self is the result, the effect, of Love. The very same Love
that has birthed the sun and the moon and all of the stars and every
dimension upon dimension upon dimension of Creation. That very Love that
desired for that Love to be extended is the very Source from which you
have been birthed. As you know yourself to be, then, you are the <em>effect
of God‚Äôs desire to extend Love.</em></p>

<p>Therefore, when next someone asks you, ‚ÄúOh, who are you?‚Äù, please do not
give them a name. Do not say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I was born in a certain town, in a certain part of the planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don‚Äôt tell them that you are a Democrat, or a Republican, or a
communist, or an atheist, or a Catholic. Tell them the Truth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who am I? I am the extension of Love in form. I have never been born and
I will never taste death. I am infinite and eternal. I shine forth as a
sunbeam to the sun. I am the effect of God‚Äôs Love. And I stand before
you to love you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now <em>that</em> will raise some eyebrows! It will also transform your world.
For it is time to stop seeking Christ outside and start choosing to take
responsibility for being Christ incarnate. <em>Desire is everything!</em></p>

<p>Take just a moment, right now. Let the body relax, and imagine that you
could move back from being the <em>actor</em> in the play of your life to being
the <em>director</em> and the <em>producer</em>. And you‚Äôre sitting in your laboratory,
your studio, and you‚Äôre editing the story of your life. And you‚Äôre
looking at all your little clips of film, from the time you were
birthed, the time you went to kindergarten, the time you first fell in
love, the time you first decided to go to a movie, the time you went off
to college, the time you took a job, or this job or that job, or you
moved to another physical location. And look closely and see if it is
not true, that for every action you have ever done, for every decision
you have ever made, after trying to analyze it all, is there not
underneath it the energy of <em>desire</em>?</p>

<p>For in Truth, you do not lift the body from your couch to go to the
refrigerator without the desire to eat. Something calls you into a field
of action, an expression of action. It is desire. No one enters into an
intimate relationship without the energy of desire. For who two have
ever looked upon one another and said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don‚Äôt feel any desire whatsoever, but let‚Äôs get married, have
children, and raise a family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Desire! Desire is that energy which brings forth all waves of creation
out of the depth of the ocean itself. And yet, who among you has not
felt <em>conflicted</em> about desire? Who among you has not been taught that
desire is evil? Who among you has not been taught not to desire to be
great? Who among you has not been taught that the desire for material
comfort is some sort of a blot on the spiritual path? Look well within
your soul and see if this is not true. Have you not feared, at times,
the welling up of desire within you? For well, as I look upon your
plane, there are many who become paralyzed with fear just because they
desire to have a bowl of ice cream. So afraid are they, that if they
give in to that desire, something in the ice cream will cause their body
to bloat and their brain to cease functioning. Hmm! Hmm!</p>

<p>And for those of you in intimate relationship ‚Äî what you call marriage,
a commitment of some kind (there seem to be many levels of commitment in
your world, each has its own definition) ‚Äî how many of you have not
carried the belief, taught to you by the world, that if you feel an
energy of desire welling up within yourself, when you look upon someone
who is not your partner, that somehow you have sinned against God? How
many of you, then, do not know the experience of trying to reign in the
ten thousand horses, so sure that if you gave in to feeling desire, that
everything would run amok? And your attempt to keep your life structured
and rigid and predictable, would collapse ‚Äî what you call ‚Äúall hell
breaking loose.‚Äù Hmm!</p>

<p>And yet, I say unto you, would you exist if God had feared the desire to
create and extend love by forming you, at the same time giving you
infinite freedom of choice? Without desire, look around, not only would
you see nothing, there would be nothing to do the seeing. <em>Everything</em> is
the <em>effect</em> of desire.</p>

<p>Come, then, to see that desire is not evil. It is <em>not</em> to be feared. It
is to be mastered. Mastery is not control. For control, the need to
control, is an effect of the energy of fear, and not Love. Mastery of
desire comes when you recognize that you are <em>safe</em> to feel whatever wave
of desire might come up through your consciousness, because <em>you</em> decide
whether or not you will act on it ‚Äî you will bring it into the field of
manifestation. The <em>power of choice</em> is the one power that can never be
taken from you. You already have perfect mastery of it, because nothing
you ever experience comes to you without your decision to allow it into
the field of manifestation.</p>

<p>Come, then, to feel that desire is something welling up from the depth
beyond yourself that can be looked at with perfect innocence, and with
the wonder of a child. And that that very act of turning to allow and
welcome desire is not something that will sidetrack you from the path of
awakening, but will, indeed, take you vertically, if you will, into the
Heart of God.</p>

<p>For if you are to ever create as God creates, you will need to heal your
conflicted perceptions about desire. You will need to transcend that
energy of fear.</p>

<p>There are many who call unto me and pray. There is not an hour in your
time frame in which there are not many upon your plane, somewhere on
your planet, that are praying to me, that want their hearts to be filled
with Christ. And yet, at the very same time, they are scared to death of
an energy that <em>wants</em> to move, because they have been taught to fear, to
suppress, desire.</p>

<p>Desire is like the Liquid of Life that moves through the stem of the
rose and allows the petals to radiate with glorious color. And when you
block the flow of desire, the petals cannot be nourished. Death begins
to occur ‚Äî death of the heart, death of the soul, lifelessness.</p>

<p>If you were to walk down one of your city streets and to truly look into
the eyes of everyone you see (and everyone that hears these words has
had this experience), would you not recognize that death seems to have
already made a home in the minds of many that are living ‚Äî death of
dreams, death of hope, death of worthiness, death of playfulness, death
of true power, death of union with their Source and Creator?</p>

<p>Healing requires the willingness to <em>feel desire</em>, to see it as good, to
see it as holy. Does that not mean that if you feel a desire, that it
might not become twisted by the egoic patterns in your mind? Of course
not. There‚Äôs always that possibility that desire will be twisted to meet
the needs of egoic mind within you. But rest assured, if it does, who‚Äôs
done it? You! Always within you, you know that desire is good, but you
suppressed it. Always, when desire comes forth, those times when you‚Äôve
let it become twisted into serving the goals of the ego, rest assured,
you knew perfectly well what you were doing, and you were the decision
maker.</p>

<p>You have learned, therefore, to fear desire because that fear is the
effect of <em>fearing yourself</em>. And that is what cripples you. That is what
cuts off the creative flow. That is what leads to everything your world
knows as the multitude of psychological diseases ‚Äî an unwillingness to
trust one‚Äôs self, an unwillingness to love one‚Äôs self, the belief that
the desires that move up through your beingness are something evil and
dark. If only you could stamp them out of your being, you could remain
in control and everybody would like you because you‚Äôd conform to the
smallness and the littleness that is worshipped in human consciousness.</p>

<p>Listen well, now, to the next axiom we would give you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only relationship which holds any value at all is your relationship
with God, your creative Source, the depth of the ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And right away the mind wells up,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what about my mate, what about my parents, what about my children,
what about the President of the United States, what about the
postmaster?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm! You will come up with a million examples of relationships that
surely have great importance. The <em>only</em> one which holds <em>value</em> is your
relationship with God. For when that is in alignment, all of your
creations, your choices for relationships, and how you will be within
them, will flow effortlessly from that alignment. Therefore, seek first
the Kingdom, and all these things will be added unto you. Do not try to
create a rose by starting with the petals. But nourish the roots, and
the flower must blossom.</p>

<p>If you are to be in <em>right relationship</em> with your Creator, it is
absolutely necessary to correct your perception and relationship with
the energy of desire. And it begins by releasing your judgment of it in
all of its forms. For again, you can only be in Love or fear. You can
only be in innocence or judgment. Love and innocence are of the Kingdom.
Fear and judgment are of illusion.</p>

<p>Learn then, through simple practice, to <em>interrupt the patterns</em> you‚Äôve
learned from this illusory world, so that you release judgment of the
energy of desire. This will be different for each and every one,
depending on where they begin. But to give you a very simple exercise,
when you awaken in the morning, and you‚Äôve planted your feet firmly on
your floor, take pause and ask yourself this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do I want right now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right away, the mind will say,</p>

<p>Well, I‚Äôm too busy to know what I want, I have to go off to work. I have
to serve everybody else. I‚Äôm here to satisfy the world. I have no time
to ask myself what I want.</p>

<p>Remember that what you decree <em>is</em>, and the thought you hold in the mind
will be reflected through the nature of your experience.</p>

<p>So take pause and ask,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do I want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then simply give yourself one minute to observe whatever comes up in
the mind, or even is felt in the body. Heaven forbid, you might want to
have sex! Oh! Then you would know for sure that you are not a
‚Äúspiritual‚Äù being! You might want to take a hot shower. You might want a
glass of juice or water. You might want to sing. You might want to
stretch or breathe. You might want to turn and look at your lover, your
mate, still sleeping in the bed. You might want to arise, and go and
sneak into your children‚Äôs room, and watch them sleep. You might want to
sit down and read the morning paper. But the point here is to notice
that by asking the question, something will respond within you. And when
that response comes, notice that there is a feeling associated with it,
a quality that makes your cells sing just a little bit. That is the
energy, the elixir of Life, called desire.</p>

<p>In this one minute, you need not rise to act, but to simply observe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ah, what do I want? To take a hot shower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The feeling of the thought, or the thought that emits the feeling in the
body, ‚ÄúI want to take a hot shower,‚Äù is carried on the elixir of desire.
And desire is coming from a depth of your beingness that, again, rests
right next to the Face of God. And might it not be the case that by
following the desire that wells up through your heart, by <em>feeling</em> it, by
<em>embracing</em> it, you might learn and discover what the Ocean is wishing to
express through the wave that you are? And if you judge desire, might
you not be shutting off the creative flow that the Mind of God wishes to
express?</p>

<p>Of course, that‚Äôs the problem. You‚Äôve tied the hose in a knot through
conflicted judgments. And the idea, now, is to begin ‚Äî in a simple way ‚Äî
to begin to give yourself permission to <em>feel desire</em>, to allow it even
into the cells of the body, to observe it, to notice it, to sit with it.</p>

<p>Here is a very common one in your world (be honest with yourself): How
many times have you felt the desire to be wealthy? It‚Äôs not something
you‚Äôre supposed to sit around and talk about or make very public:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boy, this morning I woke up and I just imagined having so many golden
coins that I could buy the entire planet! Oh! ‚ÄúMoney is the root of all
evil.‚Äù I can‚Äôt think that way. Well, I better get busy and get off to my
office job, that secretly, inside, I really resent , because they don‚Äôt
pay me what my soul is worth. But I‚Äôll pretend like I‚Äôm quite fine. Oh,
money? No, I‚Äôm quite fine. I really have enough, and no, no, I‚Äôm really
quite fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then as you drive home, and the Mercedes Benz pulls up along side
you, you cannot help but turn and go,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God, I wish I could afford one of those. Oh, God! I can‚Äôt have that
thought, so I‚Äôll drive my old Volkswagen down the road. But I‚Äôm being a
very good spiritual person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be honest with yourselves: How many times have you felt, welling up
within yourself, the desire to be wealthy? What on earth has caused you
to fear that desire? What has caused you to tie the hose in a knot, so
that you try to block that desire from coming into manifestation?
Perhaps, when you were a child, you went to one of your cathedrals. And
there was someone in a long robe standing upon a platform. And because
everything looked so beautiful, surely they must be speaking with
authority. And because this cathedral is filled with a whole lot of
small little minds that are all living in their own level of fear, when
that voice spoke and said, ‚ÄúMoney is the root of all evil,‚Äù you said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh. Well, that is the truth. Oh, yes. That‚Äôs the truth. Oh, yes. Oh,
God! I better fear money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm!</p>

<p>I say unto you, you have <em>one Authority</em>, and it is never held within the
office of any church, or any organization, or any one individual. Your
Authority is the Voice for God that dwells within your heart and within
your mind! God is not limited, and does not require His Children to be
limited. For if you would receive all that God would give you, you would
decide to rise up and be the grandest wave that you could possibly be.
For only in so doing do you <em>honor</em> your Creator.</p>

<p>So you could say that God is like a wise gardener who is constantly
trying to grow beautiful roses. He knows <em>exactly</em> how much moisture to
put in the soil. He knows how to make those nutrients rise from the soil
through the roots, up through the heart of the stem of the flower to
give forth radiant color, so that everyone that looks upon it is touched
by the mystery of beauty. And God wonders,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, it‚Äôs interesting. These roses that I‚Äôve created seem to have a
mind of their own. As the elixir I tried to give them rises through the
stems, they tie themselves in little knots, and only a little bit of the
elixir reaches out, and so the petals never quite blossom fully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you ever had that feeling that you‚Äôre putting more energy into
<em>staying constricted</em> than you are into <em>allowing expansion</em>?</p>

<p><em>Desire is creation.</em> Therefore, <em>what</em> you desire is of supreme importance.
If you will take the little exercise that we have given you and begin to
put it into practice, in a very simple way, and in a quiet way, you‚Äôll
begin to get back in touch with the innocence and beauty of the movement
of desire. You can delight in it. When you have a sexual thought, a
sexual desire, why not just be with it? Why not notice what it causes to
happen in the body? How does your breath change? Does the heart beat
faster? Be honest with yourself, isn‚Äôt it putting a smile on your face?
What if you decided to <em>honestly embrace</em> that effect as being <em>perfectly
innocent</em> and <em>beautiful</em>? How might your day change if you did not <em>repress
awareness</em> of sexual desire? You‚Äôll notice we‚Äôre not saying you should
walk down the street and grab every body that walks by you. We‚Äôre
talking about allowing yourself the living embrace of exactly what
energy is moving through your being.</p>

<p>Why is this important? If you have decided that there are certain
energies which are demonic, evil, have the power to distract you from
your union with God, you have already decided there is something <em>beyond</em>
the reach of your power. And that is what disempowers you. And so, you
take an innocent energy and turn it into a monster that must be feared
at all cost.</p>

<p>Yet I say unto you, the mystical transformation that carries you from
feeling yourself to be a disempowered little drop of foam on the edge
of a wave, to the sense of freedom and empowered living that flows from
the Mind of God, through you, to express only beautiful creations filled
with majesty and power and miracles ‚Äî what takes you from A to B is the
willingness to turn to the very energies that move through the mind and
the body, and to not fear them, but to look upon them with innocence and
wonder. And this is the source of the myths that have been told in all
cultures: the knight that slays the dragon, kissing the wild beast on
the cheek and it becomes a loving, loving companion. Your monsters are
what you fear and repress, because of the judgments you have learned in
the world. And the world is only the denial of the Kingdom. It is the
exact opposite of Truth.</p>

<p>So you see, if you‚Äôre sitting in one of your cathedrals and everyone is
saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, yes. Sexuality, very bad! It will keep you from God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right away, you should realize if everyone here is fearing sexuality, it
must actually be Divine, and,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps I would do well to embrace it, and love it, and master it, and
not fear it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If someone says unto you,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Money is the root of all evil,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and then sticks out his hand, and says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you please make a donation to our organization? .¬†.¬†.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is that not an expression of conflict? And yet, such conflict <em>permeates</em>
the religions and dogmas of your world:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don‚Äôt desire money. Don‚Äôt desire wealth. By the way, to keep on this
radio station, we really need you to send a donation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are they trying to teach you? What are they in denial of?</p>

<p>Sex and money. Pretty basic things, aren‚Äôt they? They represent energies
that flow from the Mind of God, that would express in unlimited joy and
power, and not be willing to settle for limitation of any kind.</p>

<p>When the earth was birthed from God‚Äôs Holy Mind, and took on its own
form, and became an entity just like you, God did not say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, this is a pretty beautiful planet, but I can only have a solar
system just large enough for the Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather, out of joy, God allowed there to come forth solar system upon
solar system upon solar system, the birthing of a thousand suns every
moment, as a field in which this beautiful jewel of a planet could spin.
<em>That</em> is true creation! And what quality of solar system have you decided
to allow, in which the planet of your own awareness can spin and live
and express?</p>

<p>Ah desire! Desire is everything. And again, the simple exercise we‚Äôve
given you will begin to free up the blocks within, and you will
rediscover the <em>innocence of desire</em>. And then, you can begin to expand
upon it, to take a few moments to learn to live deliberately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do I truly want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For you see, because your mind shines forth like a sunbeam to the sun
from the Mind of God, when you use your consciousness to relax into the
innocence of the question</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWhat do I truly want? What is it
in my heart that keeps calling to me, keeps 
compelling me?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Ä¶ pictures begin to arise, feelings begin to arise. And I say unto you, they
are expressions of ‚Äî and we‚Äôll speak through the symbols that you understand of
your world ‚Äî they are expressions of what God wants to bring forth <em>through</em>
you,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, every time I look in my heart, and every time I allow myself to feel
it, what I really want is ‚Äî I want to put my arms around people. I want
to let people know how much I love them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why fear such a desire?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs too overwhelming. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll be accepted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who cares how you‚Äôll be accepted? What matters is how you accept
<em>yourself</em>.</p>

<p>What if by feeling that desire, new pictures began to come to you? And
suddenly you realized, ‚ÄúWhat I want to do is join the Peace Corps,‚Äù as
an example. Perhaps it is the case that that very decision to go and put
yourself in a solar system where you can spin as your own planet, where
you can go and be in the Peace Corps, could be the very pathway through
which you learn to receive the great joy of letting your Love out into
the world. But if you fear desire, how can you ever know these things?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, when I get in touch with my heart, and when I allow myself to feel
‚Ä¶!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What comes up by asking that question?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to have so much wealth. Oh! And I see the thought that says, ‚ÄúOh,
no! Wealth is bad.‚Äù But what I want to do is, I want to be able to go to
every hungry child on the planet and feed them. That‚Äôs why I want to be
wealthy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could it not be that the desire to feed the world is God‚Äôs desire to
speak through you, to use you in a way that effects transformation upon
your planet? Can you see, then, that by blocking the feeling of desire
you might just be blocking yourself from hearing what you keep praying
for, over and over?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Father, reveal Thy purpose to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You feel the desire and you go,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oops! First ‚Ä¶ excuse me, Father ‚Ä¶ I have to get rid of this
desire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Desire in the heart is where you will discover the phone line that links
you to the Will of God that would be expressed through you. And if you
don‚Äôt trust desire, you are literally saying that you have decided not
to trust your Creator. Hmm ‚Ä¶ not something to just be brushed aside.</p>

<p>In healing the conflict around desire, now that you know what it truly
is, learn to be <em>patient</em> with yourself.</p>

<p>By way of a second exercise, and we would suggest that you create a
structure by which this can be practiced that fits into your own life.
Again, it need not take more than five, ten, or fifteen minutes,
initially, perhaps three or four times a week. Eventually, you‚Äôll be
doing this all the time, because you‚Äôll be creating deliberately. For
just ten or fifteen minutes, set aside your world. Remember that you
need do nothing, and so the world can wait.</p>

<p>Relax the body and close the eyes. And it can be of great benefit to let
the breath become very deep and rhythmic; it relaxes the nervous system
and seduces the controller within your mind, the critic that decides
what thoughts are okay and which ones aren‚Äôt. By the way, the critic is
never something you created. It is something you let live in your mind
that was made up by a lot of other fearful minds, called parents and
teachers.</p>

<p>As you relax the body and the mind, ask yourself,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do I truly want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And observe the images that come, without judgment. Notice the feelings
in the body, and allow this to go for just a minute or two. Then pause,
open the eyes, and write down all that you can remember.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I saw the image of having forty-seven sexual partners.</p>

  <p>I saw the image of having golden coins rain down upon me so that I have
to have an umbrella over my head.</p>

  <p>I saw huge bowls of ice cream.</p>

  <p>I saw myself in a boat on the ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever it is, write it down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I notice that my stomach got tight.</p>

  <p>I thought I was going to pee my pants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever it is, write it down.</p>

<p>Then, take a deep breath, relax again, and repeat the process. Place the
hand so that it rests on the heart. Breathe into it a few times, and
then ask,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do I truly desire?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, allow the process to be what it is. Do this over a period of
ten or fifteen minutes so that you repeat the process at least six or
seven times, writing them down.</p>

<p>Take the piece of paper, perhaps in a journal, as you would call it, and
put it aside until the next exercise period, and then again repeat the
process. When you have done this seven times, so that you have seven
sheets of paper in which you‚Äôve gone through this process, then, and
only then, begin to look back through all the things that came up. And
then ask yourself,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What seems to be repeating itself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might notice,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, three times I wanted a huge bowl of ice cream, but then it seemed
to fade away.</p>

  <p>Twice I had a desire for forty-seven lovers, but now I notice that I‚Äôm
really only wanting one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever it might be, notice the pattern, the thread, that seems to run
the most throughout the exercise periods. Then, imagine that thread to
be that energetic link that is tied at one end to the piece of foam at
the edge of the wave, and the other is anchored to the Depth of the
Ocean. And then consider that perhaps if you allowed yourself to move
down that thread, to begin to put your energy on that, to begin to clear
up the obstacles within your consciousness that block that desire from
being consistently lived from, that by so doing, you would carry
yourself from the drop of foam at the edge of the wave to the Heart of
God. And that along the way, everything unlike Love would come up for
you to release it. And that during the process, you would go through a
<em>metamorphosis</em> that would culminate in your being the <em>living incarnation
of the Power of Christ</em> ‚Äî that your soul would <em>realize the fulfillment</em>
that it has always sought. Hmm! Something to take a big gulp over.</p>

<p>For you see, the reason you have cleverly decided to trick yourself into
blocking the energy of desire is that the soul knows that, were it to
follow such a thread, <em>through whole and total commitment</em>, it will be
embarking on the pathway we spoke of in an earlier hour, the pathway set
before you by God, that knows how to take you home.</p>

<p>And if you arrive at home, it will mean that you will have had to give
up being a <em>seeker</em>. And you will have had to become one who is <em>found</em>. And
you will have to rise above the crowd. You will have to give up all of
your identity with smallness. You will have to give up needing the
approval of others. You will have left the nest of insanity. You will
have arisen and taken up your right place at the right hand of God.
Isn‚Äôt that the deepest fear you carry .¬†.¬†. to actually be the Truth of
who you are: <em>Christ Incarnate</em>?</p>

<p>Now, desire can be much fun. Ideally, once you‚Äôve practiced this on your
own, ask your mate or a close friend (you may even want to show them
this talk on your video) ‚Äî and ask a friend if they would be willing to
embark on this process with you, so that, perhaps once a week, you can
sit down together, and say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What did you come up with this week?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, here goes‚Ä¶ !</p>

<p>It is called <em>undressing</em> in front of a friend. It is called becoming
<em>vulnerable</em> with another. It is called <em>finding another child to play with
in the Kingdom</em>, so that you can go to the sand box, away from the adult
world that says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Desire is bad. You guys be careful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you begin to look at what is true and real from a place of
innocence. And you begin to create for yourself a <em>support group</em>. And
that support group perhaps can grow to three or four friends ‚Äî or even
ten or twenty ‚Äî in which everyone is involved with getting in touch with
what‚Äôs really in there, by understanding the principle that <em>desire is
the thread that links your soul to the Heart of God</em>. And God wants only
to extend, through you, that which expresses Love in the world. It is
called Creation.</p>

<p>Perhaps, a worthwhile project. For when you do not turn to allow the
embrace of desire, there is only one alternative. It is to live in <em>mere
survival</em>. And when you choose the energy of mere survival, the <em>world</em> is
your master, before which you will be made to bow again and again and
again and again and again ‚Äî lifetime after lifetime after lifetime! You
will be a <em>slave</em> to the insanity that seems to rule this world. And you
will never know <em>peace</em>. And you will never know <em>joy</em>. <em>And you will never
come home.</em> Plain and simple! For you were not created to wither and die
on the vine. <em>You were made to bear forth much good fruit.</em></p>

<p>Let the roots be watered by desiring, above all things, to become the
fulfillment of what God had in Mind when He breathed into you the Breath
of Life. And let that Breath be received in each moment. You will come
to see that the only question ‚Äî the <em>only</em> question ‚Äî you need be
preoccupied with is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much of God am I willing to receive and allow to be expressed
through me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is called the separating of the wheat from the chaff. The chaff are
the thinkings of the world that would have you believe in smallness.
This can only result in your perpetual suffering. The wheat is the food
that gives Life, because it is filled with the Love of God.</p>

<p>Fear not, then, desire. But desire to <em>embrace</em> desire. Touch it, feel it,
know it, dance with it, sing with it, look at it <em>innocently</em>. <em>Feel it
wholly.</em> And then learn to discern, through the ways we‚Äôve given you,
what desire is truly: that thread that‚Äôs shining forth through all of
your days. And then decide to let that desire inform your choices, so
that you create a life that serves the fulfillment of that thread of
desire.</p>

<p>You see, I had to do the same. For I began to notice that there was a
thread of desire in my heart to create some form of demonstration that
would be so overwhelming that <em>anyone</em> who turned their attention to it
could not help but be reminded that there is something far greater to
life than living to survive, and surviving just to live. And even when I
was young, I began to get glimpses ‚Äî at first, they were fleeting.
Something was compelling me. But as I learned to trust desire, the
pictures became clearer and clearer. And I saw myself standing on
hilltops, surrounded by multitudes. And I marveled at the words that
came through my mouth in these moments of revelation, when I was still
but a teenager. I saw glimpses and pictures of being loved by millions.
I saw pictures and things that I couldn‚Äôt even comprehend, because they
were literally pictures of what I‚Äôm doing <em>now</em>. And how could a teenager,
living in Judea two thousand years ago, have any way of comprehending
the use of the technologies of your modern world in which to communicate
Love? It made no sense to me. But still, I decided to trust it.</p>

<p>A part of that thread was the recognition that death is unreal. And so,
therefore, I ought to be able to create a demonstration that would prove
it. Now, think about that for a moment. If that thought was born in you,
and you tried to share it with the world, wouldn‚Äôt you be told you were
crazy to dare to think a thought so out of line with everything the
world believes? But because I followed the <em>thread of desire</em>, I began to
realize that it kept <em>speaking</em> to me, day after day, and week after week.
It wanted to grow. It wanted to be nurtured.</p>

<p>So finally, I decided,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am going to allow that thread to be nurtured. And I‚Äôm going to
discover where it takes me, and what it‚Äôs all about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And where it took me was into mastery of life and death, mastery of
healing, mastery of consciousness. It took me into mastery of myself. It
brought me home to my own Christed Beingness.</p>

<p>Because I followed that thread, I can talk with you today. There are
many of you that appreciate what I have done, because you see me as a
spokesperson for the Truth. Is it not time that <em>you</em> followed your <em>own</em>
thread, and became, likewise, a spokesperson for reality? For just as
you have been sent to <em>me</em>, there will be many sent to <em>you</em>, as you step
from being a <em>seeker</em> to a <em>finder</em>. For as you take up your right place,
you become a vehicle through which the Voice for God will creatively
touch the lives of countless persons that you may never ever meet
physically.</p>

<p>You were birthed to be grand. You were birthed for greatness. You were
birthed to shine forth such Light into this world that the world
remembers that Light is true, and darkness is illusion. Be you,
therefore, that which you are. And <em>you are the Light of the world</em>. And I
will delight in journeying with you. For if I can join with this, my
beloved brother, to create communication, so too, can I join with anyone
who chooses to step into their own Christedness. And the thread is the
<em>thread of desire</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, begin to turn toward the energy of desire within yourself ‚Äî
to separate the wheat from the chaff ‚Äî by first learning to feel it, for
just a minute, without judging it, and then to <em>deepen</em> that process. And
I tell you, you will reach the point where, with every breath you
breathe, you are in touch with the energy of desire. And that is the
only Voice that you will give authority to.</p>

<p>And you won‚Äôt be able to keep up with the loving creation that wants to
express through you. And you will marvel at the friends that come into
your life ‚Äî how your external solar system, in which your planet is
spinning, changes. You will marvel and wonder how it‚Äôs all happening.
And you will finally discover that you are not the <em>maker</em> and <em>doer</em> of
your life, that God wants to direct and make Life through you.</p>

<p>And then you will know the Truth that sets you free:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of myself, I do nothing. But my Father, through me, does all things. And
it is very good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be you, therefore, at peace. And <em>desire well</em>. For when you feel desire,
you are watering your roots with the energy of Life itself. <em>Trust it!
Embrace it!</em> And let the petals of the rose <em>blossom</em> within your Holy
Being.</p>

<p>We love you, and we are with you. If you could only see how much
enlightened help there is surrounding you at any moment, you would never
allow the fear of going astray with your desire to be victorious within
your mind. And you would step forth with boldness. And all things would
be made new again.</p>

<p><em>How much of God‚Äôs Love are you willing to receive?</em></p>

<p>And with that, we close by saying,</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
