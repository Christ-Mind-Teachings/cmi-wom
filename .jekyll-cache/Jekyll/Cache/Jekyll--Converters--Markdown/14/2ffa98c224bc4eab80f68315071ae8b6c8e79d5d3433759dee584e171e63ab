Source of our Being,<br />
we are returned.</p>

<p>Joining together,<br />
we celebrate the Love that,<br />
together, we are.</p>

<p>Where there has been an unreal world,<br />
we now give birth to a world atoned,<br />
that it may perfectly reflect<br />
what you have completed in us.</p>

<p>Because we are made,<br />
even in this moment,<br />
in your image,<br />
our love is without ceasing,<br />
forever, and ever, and ever!</p>

<p><em>Amen</em></p>
