<p><span class="capital1">S</span>tepping out of the waiting area at the
airport gate, I am hit by the sweet, delicious fragrances of Maui, the
heart-island. Closing my eyes, I drink deeply with my breath this
intoxicating scent. It’s enough to bring a touch of tears to my eyes. Is
it okay to consider an island your most precious of loves?</p>

<p>I step onto the escalator that takes me down toward baggage claim, then
it will be onto the rental car bus, and then, and then, what? Why have I
come here, really?</p>

<p>I am a patient sitting in the waiting room of the Grand Cosmic Doctor.
My symptoms?</p>

<p>Hearing the voice of Jeshua.</p>

<p>Being shown images of events that haven’t occurred.</p>

<p>Feeling compelled from a place in me that is beyond me to follow an
unseen trail through a territory I never knew existed until I found
myself in it!</p>

<p>Is there a pill for this?</p>

<p>Hunger! Thank God! I can always count on my appetite to serve as a
needed distraction! There’s a great little health food store not far
from the airport, in Wailuku, called Down to Earth. And I could use a
little of that!</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>Having paid for my salad and carrot juice, I turn to head out the door,
when my eyes catch a stack of magazines at the end of the counter. It
looks like some sort of local thing, so I throw it into my bag, and
head, where else? To the beach!</p>

<p>The sand is hot beneath my feet, and even the sound of the gentle surf
rolling onto the shore seems soft. In fact, the whole island of Maui
feels soft; as soft as velvet.</p>

<p>Having cleverly put on my swimming suit just before landing, I kick off
my shorts, peel off my shirt, and run into into the warm tropical ocean
waters. I open my eyes to the sting of salt water, delighting in the
endless visibility. Ribbons of sunlight dance downward toward a sandy
bottom further and further away from me as I swim out, and out, out into
this incredible, healing ocean.</p>

<p>Relaxing on my back, arms outstretched, I bob in the gentle, lapping
waves one hundred yards offshore, gazing at dancing wisps of clouds in
an enless blue sky. I can’t contain a long, loud scream. This time, of
utter ecstasy! At just that moment, my hunger returns with a vengeance.
Turning over in the water, I look toward the distant shore, and beyond
to majestic Haleakala, house of the sun, the mountain that really is
East Maui, at whose sandy feet I will rest, and eat.</p>

<p>Gulping down the last of my carrot juice, my eyes rest on the thin
magazine I picked up at the store. I start to absentmindedly thumb
through it, occasionally noticing a short article here, ads for things
like yoga, sufi dancing, and what-have-you. I am more than a little
distracted from reading by a couple of remarkably attractive bikini-clad
women baking in the sun, thankfully not all that far from me.</p>

<p>Sparkling, warm ocean to swim in. Great food. Jungles, waterfalls,
hidden pools, and an extinct volcano. And bikinis. No wonder they call
Hawaii ‘paradise’.</p>

<p>“I could definitely live here,” I mutter, forcing my eyes back to the
magazine. “Maybe someday.”</p>

<p>At just that moment I am drawn to a small ad at the base of the page.
It’s really the face I am drawn to, but why? What is this sudden jolt of
energy in my spine? It isn’t anyone I know, but I somehow know I need to
know her. Next to her picture are simple words:</p>

<p>‘Sara Patton. Wordsmith. Manuscript preparation, friendly support for
authors.’</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes, I have completed my call to her from a phone
booth, and my appointment is set for tomorrow. I just know Sara will be
the one to shape <em>The Jeshua Letters</em> into form. And I haven’t even made
it to my condominium yet!</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>Sara is entirely focussed as she reads through page after page. I can’t
notice anything that tells me if she likes it or not. She turns pages a
bit faster, so maybe she is losing interest. I’m sure that must be it. I
knew it. This was just my fanciful mind playing tricks on me, again.</p>

<p>She stops on the last page. It’s taking her way too long as I watch her
eyes follow each line, then again, and yet again. The silence is
palpable.</p>

<p>Finally, she looks up at me. Still reading, but not the manuscript.</p>

<p>“I would be honored to help you prepare this.”</p>

<p>Did she really say that?</p>

<p>“You have had quite an experience. Is it still going on?” She closes the
binder, and turns to place it on her desk. I recognize it is no longer
in my hands. But then, was it ever?</p>

<p>“Well,” I stammer a bit. “I mean, the manuscript is done, almost, but,
no, I have a feeling things are just getting started.”</p>

<p>Her warm smile relaxes me.</p>

<p>“It’s okay. I work a lot with spiritually-based authors, so I can
understand something about how this must be for you. But don’t worry. If
He chose you for this, He will handle things for you.”</p>

<p>She seems nonchalant, matteroffact, and reassuring, all at the same
time.</p>

<p>“In fact, I know who would love this, and it would be wonderful because
maybe he would provide an endorsement for you!”</p>

<p>“Who are you talking about?” I ask her.</p>

<p>“Oh! Sorry, I just got really excited for some reason. Alan Cohen. Do
you know his work? He lives right here on Maui. It would be easy to get
him a copy of this!”</p>

<p>Jeeeeeeezzzzzzzuuuuusssssss!</p>

<p>I can’t help it. I start laughing a nervous laugh, and finally tell Sara
about the ‘prophecy’ Jeshua had given me concerning Alan, this stranger
I have never met, but - through Sara - will soon be reading <em>The Jeshua
Letters</em>.</p>

<p>“Well, you see? Just as I said! If He chose you to bring this through,
it looks like He is already a step ahead of you!”</p>

<p>Or, maybe a thousand. I wonder if I will ever catch up. I used to think
my salvation was in becoming a know-it-all. But it is beginning to feel
like the real direction is in becoming a trust-it-all!</p>

<p>My meeting ends with my signature on a contract, and Sarah’s promise to
get to work immediately. She will get the manuscript to Alan within the
week, but just as I am leaving, she decides to give me his phone number.</p>

<p>“It feels like it would be best for you to call him, first.”</p>

<p>And with that I leave Sara Patton, wordsmith, and drive away from her
apartment in Maalaea, back along the road that runs next to Sugar Beach,
back toward my condo in paradise, and toward something I am beginning to
dread.</p>

<p>Soon, I will be calling a perfect stranger, and saying something like,</p>

<p>“Hi, there. You don’t know me from Adam, but I have this manscript.
What’s it about? Well, does the name ‘Jeshua’ mean anything to you? No?
I didn’t think so.”</p>

<p>Egad! I have to tell a perfect stranger about this. It was one thing to
let Sara read the manuscript. At least that gave me some distance! But
now, I have to ‘cold-call’ a stranger, and ‘fess up! Boy, do I need to
take a nice, long swim. How far is it back to Tacoma, anyway?</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>“Aloha! This is Alan!”</p>

<p>The voice is gentle, open, enthusiastic. And he doesn’t even know who is
calling yet. God, do even the people living here take on this soft Maui
quality? Somehow, I stammer through introducing myself, letting Alan
know Sara has referred me to him.</p>

<p>“Well, if Sara likes it, it must be good. She does great work, you know.
You have been dropped into good hands!”</p>

<p>I wonder if he’ll say that after I tell him by Whom! I begin to blurt it
out. All of it. When done, I stop, and listen to my heart beating fast
in the otherwise silent interlude.</p>

<p>In my mind’s eye, I abruptly see an image of Alan, his eyes closed, as
if praying about what I have told him. I also see Jeshua, standing near
him, smiling at me. At just that moment, the inner image disappears,
replaced by Alan’s voice.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, but I felt the need to close my eyes and tune in to
Spirit.”</p>

<p>My mental image was a coincidence, I’m sure.</p>

<p>“Your manuscript feels good to me,” he continues. “I would be happy to
read it.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I’ll give Sara a call, and she can send over a copy to me. How
long will you be on Maui?”</p>

<p>He’s actually going to read it! “Uh, only another week. Unless, of
course, I move here.”</p>

<p>Move here! Of course! I mean, it’s not like I have a job to get back to!
Wow!</p>

<p>Alan laughs. “She’s stealing your heart already, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“She?”</p>

<p>“Mother Maui! Somebody has to say ‘yes’ to their joy. Might as well join
us!”</p>

<p>Saying ‘yes’ to joy? Really? Fully? Is that okay? Does it actually work?</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>My talk with Alan ends. I just couldn’t quite bring myself to tell him
one little piece. The bit about Jeshua saying he would write a foreword
for the book. I mean, this is our first ‘date’, after all!</p>

<p>After hanging up the phone, I walk outside and sit on the grass. It’s
nearing sunset time. The tradewinds are slacking off to a gentle caress.
The sun is deliciously, almost erotically, exquisite on my face and
arms. A cardinal lands on the grass, eyeing me for a bite of something.</p>

<p>“Sorry, friend. I have nothing to give you, unless you would happen to
like some interesting bedtime reading!”</p>

<p>I show him my empty hands, he tilts his little head from side to side a
few times, then flies off. The light is beginning to turn golden, like
liquid gold shaping into rivulets as the sun nestles down behind the
edge of the island of Lanai out on the horizon.</p>

<p>I look around….Maui. Live here, in all this beauty? Me? It dawns on me I
can be broke here as easily as anywhere. And, after all, there is
someone working on the manuscript. Maybe I ought to trust that. Yes!
That is exactly what I am going to do!</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I look up at the stars, then the looming curve of
Haleakala, and breathe in those amazing sweet scents, Mother Maui is
seeming more and more like home.</p>

<p><em>Who am I kidding here, I think to myself. It felt like home the first
time I came here back in 1973. The year I began meditation practice.
Where I met my first Zen master. Maui is the comfortable pair of jeans I
put in the closet and forgot about Why did I do that? Why wasn’t I
willing - or able - to let myself be where I love to be the most?</em></p>

<p>That thought strikes me hard. It is like a symbol of far deeper things,
isn’t it? After all, what has kept me all these years, all these
lifetimes revealing themselves like fragments of a forgotten dream since
Jeshua’s appearance; what has kept me from opening to really receive the
heart and soul of the Truth so obvious in His words? I have to know, to
really and fully know, what that is all about! Not just for me, for all
souls. Just what keeps the world spinning around as it does? What keeps
suffering in place, like a broken record?</p>

<p>And in the snap of a finger, one key moment of my life explodes into
awareness:</p>

<p><em>Vietnam. I am eighteen. The firefight was horrific, sudden, deadly for
too many. Now I stand digging yet another foxho lein yet another unknown
spot in a never-ending jungle in the central highlands. Looking up, I am
transfixed by the most beautiful sunset I have ever seen. Such beauty!
Is it the shocking contrast of beauty and pain that does it? For I am
being stretched to infinity, until the sunset is in me as much as I was
just a moment ago looking at it. There is no end to me, all things are
within me, and I pervade all things. Then, as suddenly as it began, I am
again standing with shovel in hand. I notice it is dark. At least an
hour must have passed! Why did no one disturb me? Awareness of the
night, and the jungle sounds I have learned to hear so acutely in
service to survival, returns. I jump down into my foxhole and look up at
the few stars I can see through the canopy.</em></p>

<p><em>“What the hell was that? God, if there is such a thing, I have to know
what that was! And, and what is this; this insanity in the world, and
this beauty, what the hell is going on, really? I have to know! Tell me,
dammit!”</em></p>

<p>There is no reply and, in time, I am again a soldier in heigtened alert
against the danger out there, hidden in the jungle. A mosquito brings me
back to the present. With a slap, I realize it just had its last moment
of life. I’d forgotten that moment in Vietnam. It got buried under the
deluge of the rest of that year, and of years since then.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>Maui is resting into the coming night, but the air is still so soft and
sweet. Such beauty! I leap up to my feet.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s that! It’s cold in Tacoma! Hey, Mother Maui! Meet your
newest resident!”</p>

<p>Opening the screen door to go inside, one simple thought arises:</p>

<p><em>Perhaps my soldier’s prayer was heard, and - for Christ’s sake - just
maybe all of this, every moment since that night has all been part of
the unfolding of the Answer.</em></p>

<p>It isn’t just a thought in my head. It resounds from head to toe.</p>

<p>“Damn,” I utter.</p>

<p>Undressing and laying on the bed - with no need to close windows or pull
up the covers - I simply rest, feeling my breath rise and fall, learning
bit-by-bit to be present with it as Jeshua has been instructing me,
feeling it enter, not just into my lungs, but oozing in through every
pour, streaming out as every tension dissolves into Light.</p>

<p class="indent">Remember, my brother, to let God’s love breathe you.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day I will know what that really means. I no longer trust my
intellect’s understanding, the one thing I had always banked on! Perhaps
He is right. On the road of a genuine spirituality, maybe there really
is nothing to be gained. Only everything mistakenly accumulated to be
lost, leaving room only for the Reality of God.</p>

<p>What would it mean, really, to submit to such a journey that many would
think insane? Holding hands is one thing, making love another, but
really surrendering to be ravished, to be utterly taken, well, that is
another thing entirely. It feels like I have been invited to a party I
grow more wary of, the closer I get, no matter how inviting the music!</p>

<p>I roll over on my stomach, eyes falling on the branches of
night-blooming jasmine prancing gently in the breeze. If only I could
surrender as easily as it seems to, to breezes unseen! It certainly
doesn’t seem to contract in fear, or wallow in complaints and confusion,
nor demand how the breeze tosses it! It just seems to enjoy the dance.</p>

<p>I close my eyes. Right now, there is nothing to do. I live here now, and
have no plan. Funny, but it doesn’t seem to matter. Kendra will be
surprised, but maybe not! There is nothing to do but get to know Maui
better.</p>

<p>My attention turns toward Him, that ancient Friend out there in the
ethers of reality, unseen by the eyes of the body, but not missed by the
eyes of the heart:</p>

<p><em>Jeshua, if you want the book published, you are gonna have to do it
yourself. I could make it happen, but what would that prove? I refuse to
make anything happen with this! In fact, if you are who you say you are,
you are going to have to prove it, and I mean, shatter every last doubt
I have!</em></p>

<p>The energy of that thought is so strong it makes me sit up on the edge
of the bed. “Whew, where did that come from?” I wonder.</p>

<p>I make my way to the shower, and stand beneath slightly cool waters,
tumbling from forehead down across closed eyes, streaming to the drain
at my feet. There’s a strange feeling deep down in my belly, almost to
my pubic bone. It’s new, like I have just discovered some subtle room in
my house I didn’t know was there. How odd!</p>

<p>An image appears. It’s a large trap door in a wooden floor. It appears
right where the strange feeling is occurring. This time, I manage not to
move away from it, but into it, putting into practice what He has been
teaching me. To feel into the edge of resistance. He has said someday I
will know that doing so is to be the presence of Love itself.</p>

<p>A soft whisper emerges from me: “I will trust you, Jeshua. All the way.
There is no other way left now. No turning back to familiar ground.
There is only one way to ever know what this strange, new territory with
you is really all about.”</p>

<p>The trap door opens, and the strange feeling increases. I feel like I am
falling, or opening, or, well, I am not sure. My whole body feels
different. Whatever the trap door has opened me to, now feels to be
everywhere, in every cell. And the streaming water feels so wondrous!</p>

<p>His voice startles me. It comes from behind me, and I would swear I can
feel the presence of Him standing behind me. But I don’t turn to look.</p>

<div data-index="1" class="indent">
  <p>Very well, My brother.<br />
For this have I waited patiently longer<br />
than you currently know.<br />
There is much to set in place,<br />
and we now commence<br />
our chosen Work together.</p>

  <p>Your only role is to allow Me to lead this,<br />
until our purpose is completed.</p>

  <p>Doubt will come, and go, and rise again.<br />
Strive only to remember this moment,<br />
and you will not again be defeated<br />
as in an ancient past.</p>

  <p>Now,<br />
return to your Tacoma.<br />
There are old friends waiting,<br />
and I come with you to call them<br />
to Myself yet again.</p>

  <p>For the time is at hand.<br />
All things will come to be remembered by you,<br />
in due time.</p>

  <p>Let your ancient faith in Me be restored,<br />
and trusted until My promise to you is fulfilled,<br />
and you are fully returned into the Father.</p>

  <p>Trust, beloved brother, the love for Me you have<br />
allowed to be rekindled.</p>

  <p>Nothing else need be done, but this.</p>

</div>

<p>An invisible field of energy seems to release me. I turn off the shower,
and return to the bed, where I lay quietly stunned for some time.</p>

<p>I think I have started a new job, but don’t remember when I signed the
contract! And I think union benefits are out of the question. But, for
now, at least, the resistance is gone.</p>

<p>“So much for living on Maui.” With that, I roll over, into a very deep,
deep sleep.</p>

<div class="center">
  <p class="omit"><img src="/t/wom/public/img/wom/line4.jpg" alt="line" /></p>
</div>

<p>“You <em>what!!!???</em>”</p>

<p>My shock has exploded loudly, causing passersby in the airport corridor
to turn and look, and the elderly lady at the phone next to me has
dropped her coins in her coffee!</p>

<p>“Sorry, ma’am,” I mutter apologetically. She moves to a different phone.</p>

<p>“Kendra, run that by me again. You say you gave the manuscript away? To
a stranger?”</p>

<p>Kendra recounts her story, interrupted by my groans. Sighing, I try to
shrug it off.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s done is done. No, it’s, it’s okay. Guess if I am gonna do
this trust thing. I don’t get to pick and choose. Hey, my flights about
to board. Yeah, bye.”</p>

<p>We hang up and I saunter, slowly, toward my gate, half muttering to
myself.</p>

<p><em>Kendra has handed my manusript to a perfect stranger, saying only she
felt a strong impulse to do so. No idea who, much less, why.</em></p>

<p>As I make my way onto the plane, the one that is carrying me away from
this island I love and back to winter’s cold in Tacoma simply because
some part of me is choosing to heed a voice that comes from a being I
can’t even see. I recall watching episodes of Star Trek where they would
suddenly lose control of the Enterprise, then a voice would boom over
their speakers:</p>

<p>‘You have entered the land of the Borgs. We are in complete control of
your ship. Resistance is futile.’</p>

<p>Captain Kirk, I think I know how you must feel. Good bye, Maui</p>
