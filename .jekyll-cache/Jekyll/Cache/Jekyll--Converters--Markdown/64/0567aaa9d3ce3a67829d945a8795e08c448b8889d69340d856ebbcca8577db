<p>What role does Jeshua want me to play in the bringing of Heaven to Earth?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>

<p>I want you to sell the tickets! Hmm. Might as well create some profit
for yourself here! Hmm.</p>

<p>Again, beloved brother, levityâ€Šâ€”â€Šfor as you ask the question, it comes
from a certain pattern of heaviness that there is something you must
look to outside of yourself, that you must subordinate yourself to
something you should do. That is a pattern of the worldâ€™s thinking,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I have to go off to work today. Well, I should get out of bed.
After all, itâ€™s whatâ€™s expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world mind is constantly looking outside of itself, for an employer,
for a boss, for God, for a priest, for a lover, for a child, for
whatever. Some in their drunken stupor would look for a lightpost to
give them direction of what they should and shouldnâ€™t do. Hmm!</p>

<p>And yet I say unto you, beloved friend, listen well: you need do nothing
save to choose to open and receive the Love of God, to allow the mind to
be corrected so that wherever you are, you know you are Home, you are at
peace, you and your Father are One. Then, as the Holy Spirit weaves the
tapestry of the Atonement, since you will probably find that your body
is still existing, there may be some requests made.  They will be simple
and you are always free to accept them or reject them. What really
matters is that you choose to become the Peace of God and allow that
peace to pervade your being. That is what influences the vibrational
frequencies of other minds, even if you never lift a physical finger.
Compare not your path or your life with others, merely teach only Love.
And seek first the Kingdom before all things of the world by reminding
yourself daily:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I and my Father are One! I need do nothing and I remain as I am
created to be! This world is harmless and already it is being
translated into reality. And the Holy Spirit doesnâ€™t even need me to
accomplish it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore be happy in each day, trust what the heart says to you each
day, allow yourself to touch joy each dayâ€Šâ€”â€Šand be at peace. And for you
especially, tell yourself a joke or two!</p>
