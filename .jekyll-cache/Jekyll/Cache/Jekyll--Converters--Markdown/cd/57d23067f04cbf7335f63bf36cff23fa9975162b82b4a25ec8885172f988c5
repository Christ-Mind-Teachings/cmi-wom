<p class="top"><span class="dropcaps">S</span>elf-mastery
and servantship<br /> are one.<br /> For where one is, the other is
found.</p>

<p>And where the other is,<br />
the one is also known.</p>

<p>Mastery is that state<br />
in which not one thing of the world<br />
<em>compels</em> you in any direction,<br />
yet not one thing of the world is judged.<br />
This must naturally follow<br />
for the mind to which peace is returned.</p>

<p>To lack mastery<br />
in any aspect of life<br />
is to lack it in all.</p>

<p>Mastery<br />
is the foundation from which<br />
the servant enacts<br />
the movement of Love<br />
proceeding from the Father<br />
through the Son,<br />
serving the one goal of Atonement<br />
by demonstrating its completion<br />
<em>in you.</em></p>

<p>This is given<br />
as a clear sign unto you:<br />
Mastery is completed when not one habit<br />
learned of the world remains;<br />
not one “love”<br />
you have miscreated for yourself<br />
is justified of you.</p>

<p>Look well, then,<br />
at the whole of your life,<br />
and behold with innocent honesty<br />
the “loves” you would keep for yourself,<br />
for what can you carry forth<br />
from death to Life?<br />
Even the body will be outshined.</p>

<p>And if you love the Father<br />
above the world,<br />
what would you leave untransformed<br />
by the radiance of your union?</p>

<p>You can give<br />
only what you possess,<br />
and what you possess exists for you<br />
only because you value it.</p>

<p>What treasure<br />
will you lay at your brother’s feet?<br />
For where your treasure is,<br />
there shall your heart be also,<br />
and your heart is all that <em>can</em> be given.</p>

<p>I have said before<br />
that the world is but a <em>symbol</em>.<br />
Choose wisely what <em>your</em> world<br />
will symbolize for you,<br />
for it is the symbols you choose<br />
which your sister will see.<br />
Thus is your heart revealed,<br />
and you have “spoken” your judgment<br />
of the Father.</p>

<p>She who knows me<br />
walks with me,<br />
and she who walks with me<br />
makes straight her path,<br />
and all things are given<br />
to the praise of what God is:<br />
Love.</p>

<p>Love embraces all things,<br />
heals all things,<br />
transforms all things,<br />
celebrates all things,<br />
and, above all,<br />
mirrors what God is <em>in</em> all things.</p>

<p>Give no thought, then,<br />
for tomorrow,<br />
neither for the things you shall eat,<br />
nor for the things you shall wear,<br />
for the Father knows you have need<br />
of these things,<br />
and He will not leave you comfortless.</p>

<p>When I once asked you<br />
to “take no thought”<br />
you unwittingly failed to hear me,<br />
deciding <em>you</em> can direct the choice<br />
of what you would eat,<br />
and what you would wear,<br />
and thus cleverly cherish<br />
the “loves” you would desire to keep.<br />
To decide for yourself<br />
is precisely to <em>take</em> thought.<br />
That is,<br />
because you failed<br />
to let the Comforter choose for you,<br />
right-mindedness was cast aside,<br />
and the real world abandoned.</p>

<p>But she<br />
who praises God in <em>all</em> things<br />
keeps no decision for herself,<br />
listening only to the Voice for God,<br />
and the servant knows<br />
the Voice speaks only<br />
with perfect reason.<br />
To cling to but one “love”<br />
you have miscreated<br />
is surely to be unreasonable,<br />
for you have learned<br />
that the symbols of the world<br />
can be but the symbols of death.<br />
Death is no longer your will,<br />
but Life.</p>

<p>I am come again unto you<br />
that you might have Life,<br />
and this more abundantly.<br />
Learn well, then,<br />
to ask before each choice:<br />
“Does this value the symbols of death,<br />
or of Life?”</p>

<p>Abiding in innocent honesty,<br />
you will realize<br />
that the Comforter’s guidance<br />
is immediate,<br />
and uncompromising.</p>

<p>Herein will be revealed to you<br />
the final meaning of my teaching:</p>

<p class="indent">Take no thought,<br />
for the Father knows<br />
you have need of these things.</p>

<p>In this,<br />
the next step <em>has</em> been taken.</p>

<p>Released from the insane belief in sacrifice<br />
and loss,<br />
not a single “love”<br />
does the servant keep for himself.</p>

<p>Knowing<br />
with a certainty beyond question<br />
who walks with him<br />
in the way that he chooses to go,<br />
he steps with gentle authority<br />
on the path set before him.</p>

<p>Caring not for what she will wear<br />
nor for what she shall eat,<br />
she listens for the Voice<br />
of the Holy One.</p>

<p>Because her prayer is only<br />
for that which can reflect<br />
the Father’s perfect Love through her,<br />
her joy is forever complete.<br />
And the Comforter’s guidance<br />
is without reproach,<br />
revealing the gifts<br />
that are brought to serve<br />
the one desire that alone arises<br />
in the holy mind of the servant:</p>

<p class="indent">That all I do<br />
and all I say,<br />
that all I think<br />
and all I share,<br />
that all I be, do, and have,<br />
reflect the radiance,<br />
the joy,<br />
the grace,<br />
the laughter,<br />
the compassion,<br />
the power,<br />
the vision,<br />
and the mastery<br />
of my Father’s one creation:<br />
Christ, I AM!</p>

<p>And the things that she wears<br />
and the things that she eats<br />
whisper to the world<br />
of the Love with which the Father<br />
has restored his precious child<br />
to her rightful place.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>Whenever you are not wholly joyous,<br />
it is because you have chosen wrongly.<br />
For from choice there follows action,<br />
and from action always experience.</p>

<p>For those with ears to hear,<br />
let them hear:<br />
He who has learned that death is unreal<br />
gladly releases the symbols of death<br />
even within the illusions of time,<br />
down to the least jot and tittle.</p>

<p>The awakened servant,<br />
having truly chosen<br />
to teach <em>only</em> Love<br />
because Love alone is desired,<br />
moves from the silent foundation of union<br />
unto Life <em>everlasting</em>,<br />
teaching only the symbols of Life,<br />
for by teaching he learns<br />
and by giving he receives.</p>

<p>The Way, then,<br />
<em>is</em> easy,<br />
and without effort.</p>

<p>From the thoughts<br />
you would choose to think,<br />
to what you would eat<br />
and what you would wear,<br />
<em>take no thought of yourself,</em><br />
but receive the guidance<br />
of the One sent unto you of the Father,<br />
because He has loved you<br />
from before the foundation of <em>all</em> worlds.</p>

<p>Herein,<br />
while time seems to last for you,<br />
are all things translated<br />
into that which reflects<br />
the holy of holies,<br />
and what was hidden is now revealed.</p>

<p>I gave even the body<br />
that it might be glorified<br />
in glad tribute to my Father.<br />
For she who gives all,<br />
receives all.</p>

<p>Remember then,<br />
what I say unto you now:<br />
If your brother is hungry,<br />
<em>you</em> are without nourishment,<br />
and if your sister is alone,<br />
<em>you</em> are separated from the feast.<br />
Because there is<br />
nothing outside you;<br />
you are the good shepherd.<br />
And l ask only for you<br />
to accept the truth<br />
that because you have chosen<br />
to awaken to your own call,<br />
the time is at hand<br />
for embracing with me<br />
all that is given you,<br />
that the world<br />
might be restored in us,<br />
the holy, unlimited,<br />
and <em>only</em> begotten child of God.</p>

<p>If you will do this with me,<br />
all things <em>will</em> be embraced,<br />
and Love will light all things.</p>

<p>Be you, therefore, of good courage.<br />
Love one another<br />
as I love you, always.<br />
Rejoice,<br />
and celebrate with one another often,<br />
for if there are two or more<br />
gathered together to embrace the world,<br />
I <em>am</em> in the midst of them.</p>

<p>We walk now with certainty,<br />
holding not one “love”<br />
back from the teacher<br />
who would heal all wounds,<br />
and translate even the body –<br />
the symbol of ego –<br />
into that which reflects only Light<br />
to a world redeemed<br />
from the dream of separation.</p>

<p>The final lesson has been learned,<br />
and now will be gladly lived:</p>

<p class="indent">There is nothing outside me.</p>

<p>Now, it is finished.</p>

<p>He who understands these words,<br />
lives them,<br />
and his life is a dance of devotion<br />
without ceasing,<br />
unlimited forever,<br />
for he knows what comes to pass.</p>

<p>The happy dream dawns now,<br />
having been placed safely within you<br />
by God himself<br />
even as you were –<br />
for but one brief moment –<br />
distracted by a tiny, mad idea.</p>

<p>My peace<br />
I give unto you.<br />
Not as the world gives,<br />
do I give unto you.<br />
Because you have received me,<br />
you give me to the world.<br />
Because you give me,<br />
do you eternally receive me,<br />
forever,<br />
and ever.</p>

<p>Peace be unto you,<br />
beloved,<br />
precious,<br />
and ancient<br />
friend.</p>

<p class="indent">Amen</p>
