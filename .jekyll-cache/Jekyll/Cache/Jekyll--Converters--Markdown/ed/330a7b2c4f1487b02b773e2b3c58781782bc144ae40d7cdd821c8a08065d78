I"(≠<p>Now, we begin.</p>

<p>And, indeed, greetings unto you, beloved and holy friends. If I speak in
the language of your world, I cannot find those words that can convey to
you the Love which I feel for you. I cannot find the words that can
convey unto you the Love I feel, that God has for all of us. If I search
the languages of your world, I cannot find a concept, a word, an idea, a
philosophy, a dogma that can contain, in Truth, the Mystery that is
closer to you than your own breath and awaits your discovery.</p>

<p>If I search throughout all of creation, if I search through the many
mansions that exist within the domains of my Father‚Äôs Creation ‚Äî and
that Creation is infinite ‚Äî try as I might, I cannot discover anything
that can truly describe <em>you</em>. I cannot find that which is of greater
value than <em>you</em>. In Truth, I cannot discover anything that speaks more
eloquently of the Love that God is, than <em>your very existence</em>. Therefore,
in Truth, I look upon you constantly, and marvel at the Radiance of my
Father‚Äôs Love.</p>

<p>It is, then, through you that I come to discover all that God is. And as
a man, when I walked upon your plane, I began to realize that the
greatest gift that I could ever receive would only come to me as I chose
to <em>surrender</em> every <em>perception</em> that I might conjure up about you, my
brother or sister, that would <em>veil</em> the Truth that is true about you
always.</p>

<!-- Track t2 -->

<p>When I was of nine years of age, I began to awaken to exactly what I am
describing to you. And as my father would take me to sit with the
elders, and as he would read from the Torah to me, I began to be
compelled by something within. Something began to speak to me, that
underneath all of the perceptions that I could create of another, there
was something Radiant and Shimmering waiting to be discovered. I began
to feel very different from my peers. I began to be preoccupied with
inner things. And when I listened to the elders speak, I would often
feel as though I had drifted far away from where they were. And pictures
would come to me, and thoughts would come to me, and feelings would come
to me that I didn‚Äôt understand, that I hadn‚Äôt assimilated into my being.</p>

<p>But something began to compel me. How might I discover how to see only
that Shimmering Radiance? Would it be possible for me to see my brothers
and sisters as my Father sees His Children? And, in Truth, I discovered
that the way to see with the Eyes of Christ begins with the acceptance
that <em>I,</em> as a creator, created in the image of God, indeed, literally
choose every experience, and call it to me; that <em>I create</em> the veils
through which I view Creation.</p>

<p>And I began to shift gears slightly. I began, even, to be seen as
someone who was rebelling against the teachings of my Essene elders. For
I began to move away from <em>striving</em> for God, from <em>striving</em> for
perfection, and began to cultivate within myself the process of
<em>allowing</em>. I discovered that if I looked upon my perceptions, my
feelings, my behavior, exactly as they were, without overshadowing them
with my own interpretations ‚Äî if I could teach myself to embrace things
with innocence ‚Äî veils began to be dissolved from my mind. For when I
was nine years old, I had already learned to be <em>fearful</em> of thinking, or
speaking, or acting, in a way that was not in conformity to the
prevailing wisdom of that time, even within the Essene community, which
had already become rather rigidified. There was already much dogma. And
dogma always leads to bickering.</p>

<p>I began to discover that if I looked with innocence upon all things, a
Light began to shine through the things I was looking at. And as I
rested more and more in this innocence, more and more, the Light would
shine.</p>

<p>And as I grew in age, I began to discover that the old teachers who
spoke of the need to, ‚ÄúForgive seventy times seven,‚Äù knew something
quite profound that had even become lost within the tradition, the
Jewish and Essene traditions, of my day. For, you see, to <em>forgive</em> means
‚Äúto choose to release another from the perceptions that you‚Äôve been
projecting upon them.‚Äù It is, therefore, an act of forgiving <em>one‚Äôs self</em>
of one‚Äôs projections. And as we begin to forgive, even unto
seventy times seven times, each time you forgive you take yourself
deeper into the purity of your own consciousness. You begin to see how
<em>profoundly</em> you have been coloring, and therefore affecting, all of your
relationships, through the simple act of not being aware of the power of
projection.</p>

<!-- Track t3 -->

<p>Therefore, I learned ‚Äî and learned well ‚Äî that <em>forgiveness is an
essential key to healing</em>. The opposite of forgiveness is judgment, and
judgment always creates separation and guilt. Judgment will evoke a
sense of guilt in the one who has been judged, unless, of course, they
are perfectly awake. But more than this, each time that you judge
anything or anyone, you have literally elicited guilt within <em>yourself</em>,
because there is a place within you, yet still, that knows the perfect
purity of your brother and sister, and sees quite clearly that <em>all
things within the human realm are either the extension of Love, or a cry
for help and healing</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, beloved friend, when you judge, you have moved out of
<em>alignment</em> with what is true. You have decreed that the innocent are not
innocent. And if you would judge another as being without innocence, you
have already declared that this is true about you. Therefore, to
practice forgiveness actually cultivates the quality of consciousness in
which, finally, you come to <em>forgive yourself</em>. And it is, indeed, the
forgiven who remember their God.</p>

<p>And so, therefore, in this hour, beloved friends, we would wish to share
with you the <em>power of forgiveness</em> ‚Äî how to cultivate it, how to refine
it, how to understand the depths of it that can be revealed to you as
you forgive seventy-times-seven times, how to bring up within you that
which has not yet been forgiven, but perhaps forgotten. We would speak
also, in this hour, of what <em>perception</em> is, and what <em>projection</em> is.</p>

<p>Beloved friends, these things are of <em>critical</em> importance. For anyone who
enters into a so-called ‚Äúspiritual path‚Äù must eventually face and deal
with their deep need for forgiveness, which is an expression of the
soul‚Äôs deep desire to be forgiven. For there is no one who walks this
plane who has not been touched by the <em>poison of judgment</em>.</p>

<p>Beloved friends, as we speak of these things, though, let not
seriousness enter the mind. For in Truth, all we are really doing is
describing for you what you need to do, and can do, in order to release
the burden of illusion that seems to cause you to feel a heaviness upon
your countenance, a sense of a lack of safety in the world. You could
think of it as taking your rheostat and turning it up a bit by
<em>enlightening</em> you, taking your burden of guilt and judgment from you.</p>

<p>Therefore, in Truth, understand well: <em>forgiveness is essential</em>. And what
has not been forgiven others, has not been forgiven you ‚Äî not by a God
that sits outside of you, for the Father never judges. What you have not
forgiven in another or in the world is but a reflection of what you
carry <em>within</em> as a burden that you cannot forgive of <em>yourself</em>.</p>

<!-- Track t4 -->

<p>You have an interesting saying in your world,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It takes one to know one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think you would even be able to judge another if there wasn‚Äôt
something within you being elicited that triggers within you the belief
that you know exactly what that other one is up to? And that‚Äôs why you
judge them. And sometimes, you judge harshly because you <em>fear</em> that
energy in yourself, or you remember how hurtful you have been when you
have acted from that energy.</p>

<p>But when you have forgiven yourself, rest assured, you will know what it
means to walk in this world yet be not of this world. You will be able
to feel the energy or the activities that any other soul may freely
choose. And you will discern that energy, you will understand that
energy, you will see through it, and still see the Face of Christ before
you. You will not react, which literally means ‚Äúto act again, as you did
in the past.‚Äù Instead, even if you are being persecuted (or to speak
from personal experience, to be nailed upon a cross), you will have
cultivated the ability to love.</p>

<p>And in all situations, no matter what another is doing, your first
response will be to enter into the quiet stillness within, and merely
ask the Holy Spirit,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would you have me say? What is most appropriate for this other soul
in this moment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For when forgiveness has purified the mind and the heart and the
emotional field of your own beingness, you will discover that you exist
only to extend Love.</p>

<p>You are the Savior of the world. And in each situation, your role is to
ask the Holy Spirit how you can serve the Atonement, the correction, the
healing, that yet needs to be acquired within another soul. So even if
one is hating you, you will not respond with defensiveness but with
curiosity, with innocent witnessing. And even if your hands have nails
going through them, I tell you truthfully, it is possible to still enter
the quiet sanctuary of the Heart and to ask of the Holy Spirit,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would you have me say or do that can serve the healing of my
brother or sister‚Äôs heart?</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Track t5 -->

<p>So, that is where we‚Äôre going. And all that we will be sharing with you,
not just in this hour, but in this year, has as its final goal your
complete <em>Christed Consciousness</em>, the fulfillment of what your own soul
desires: <em>forgiveness</em>.</p>

<p>There is, first, nothing you can be aware of in the energy of another
that you have not known in yourself. There is nothing another can say or
do, or even imagine themselves capable of saying or doing, that you have
not also known. Again, it takes one to know one. And when you perceive
another acting out of hostility, or fear, or what have you, the only way
you can recognize it is because <em>you have been there</em>.</p>

<p>The very fact that, in your world, one can murder another‚Äôs body, and
you can react with a knowledge that that is inappropriate behavior, is
because, as a soul, you know the energies involved in the attempt to
murder another. And, in Truth, if you‚Äôre honest with yourselves, you can
probably come up with at least fifty times in the last year that
murderous thoughts have entered your mind. You may not act on them, you
may not even dwell on them for more than a split second, but the energy
has come into the field of your awareness, and you have known it and
recognized it. Who, then, is less than you? Who, then, is worthy of your
judgment? No one. Who, then, is equal to you? Everyone. And who, then,
is worthy of your love? Everyone.</p>

<p>Forgiveness is the bridge that links you to the soul, the essence of
your brother or sister. Forgiveness is that bridge, that when
cultivated, will allow you to see clearly not just the energies that
another is expressing, but you will literally be able to see what events
seemed to cultivate that soul‚Äôs belief that they must act in that way to
survive, to live ‚Äî what perceptions have led them to feel justified in
their inappropriate behaviors. You will see it as clearly as though
someone had drawn a picture in front of you. And then you will see
skillfully what to say, and what to do to gently help another correct
their misperceptions of themselves and learn the path of
self-forgiveness. And when that hour comes, rest assured, you will walk
in this world, yet you will not be in it. You will be as I became. You
will be the Savior of the world.</p>

<!-- Track t6 -->

<p>What is <em>projection</em>? Projection occurs when there has first been denial
within yourself. Projection is an act in which you psychically try to
throw out of your ownership everything that you have judged as being
despicable or unworthy of you, something you don‚Äôt want. And so you will
<em>project</em> it. You will throw it up and out, and let it land on whomever
happens to be near by. Projection is the <em>effect</em> of the denial of the
first axiom that we have given you. It is the denial of the Truth that
nothing you experience has been caused by anything outside of you.
Projection then, is the attempt to <em>insist</em> that reality is other than the
way God made it. That you are not powerful, that you are a victim of
circumstances, that you‚Äôre in a world that can actually do things to you
and make you - cause you to make - decisions that you wouldn‚Äôt have
made otherwise. That is always denial. And it is a lie.</p>

<p>Projection is the denial of the first axiom of Truth. And you‚Äôve
mastered it well. When you project onto another, you will then believe
that your anger, your hatred is justified. Rest assured, there are many
in your legal system ‚Ä¶ in fact, the legal system means merely to take
the act of projection and the need to judge and to make it okay
socially, so that you need not be concerned with this other as your
brother or as your sister, who has been crying out for help. But rather
you become justified in punishment. And yet, punishment, itself, is only
the insane attempt to convince the punisher that the darkness, the evil
‚Äî whatever you want to call it ‚Äî is not in them, it‚Äôs <em>out there</em>.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, a society in which the prevalent legal view is simply
that your brother or your sister is an aspect of yourself. And if you
would help yourself, you must help them ‚Äî to meet each cry for help and
healing with forgiveness, love, and support. Can you imagine, for a
moment, what it would be like to live in such a society? How would it be
different than the world you see?</p>

<p>And yet, if you would have these things be different, it must begin with
<em>you</em>. For the way to heal the world is not by seeking to change what is
on the <em>outside</em>, but by first changing what is on the <em>inside</em>. For when
<em>that</em> change has occurred, you will become a conduit for an energy that
knows how to use your gifts, to place you in just the right situations.
And a great Power will work effectively through you ‚Äî the Power, alone,
Which knows how to heal your world. There are many, indeed, that would
love to march for peace by angrily attacking those who make war. But if
you would create peace in the world, you must be at peace within
yourself.</p>

<p>So, projection is an act of trying to get rid of what you don‚Äôt want to
own within. It is the <em>effect</em> of the denial of Truth. Projection colors
your brother or sister with the very energies that you would judge
within yourself. How, then, to begin to break the pattern of projection?
How, then, to allow the bridge of forgiveness to be built? It is
actually quite simple, but it <em>will</em> require your <em>commitment</em>.</p>

<!-- Track t7 -->

<p>I have said to you many times, that the world you see is nothing more
than the effect of the thoughts you have held within the mind.
Therefore, awakening requires the act of <em>vigilance</em> and <em>discipline</em> ‚Äî the
discipline to cultivate a way of living in which you observe your own
thoughts, in which you listen to the words that are coming out of your
mouth, in which you observe the feelings that are evoked within your
body, the reactivity that seems to own you, and to see these things as
<em>innocent</em> and simply <em>self-caused</em>.</p>

<p>When next, then, something is reflected to you by the world that causes
you to become angry, causes you to be in judgment, stop right where you
are, and look, not with judgment of your judgment, but with innocence
and honesty:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, I see that I am judging someone. That‚Äôs an interesting cloud passing
through the sky of my awareness. I wonder if I might be able to make
another choice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the mind will tell you,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But this person just broke into my house and stole my stereo. Of course
I have a right to be in judgment! I have a right to feel angry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I say unto you, anger is never justified. It doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt
experience it, but stop fooling yourself into believing that there is
some validity to it. What if that one who has just broken into your home
and taken your stereo equipment, or what-have-you (some other idol that
you love ‚Ä¶. hmm), what if you understood that you had the power in
that moment to remember that all events are neutral? They merely provide
you with a chance to choose Love.</p>

<p>What if you literally chose the ‚Äúinsane‚Äù way, according to the world, of
looking upon that one, who has just done that act, as a brother or
sister who is crying out for help and healing, who does not know how to
live in this world without being of the world, who does not know the way
to self-forgiveness, that does not know the Truth of the Light that
lives within them, that does not recognize their great power to create
whatever they want in a way that is not hurtful to anyone ‚Äî to look upon
them with compassion rather than reactivity?</p>

<!-- Track t8 -->

<p>It begins in simple ways. And to set the stage, I want you to very much
remember that time has been given to you that you might use it
<em>constructively</em>. That means when you awaken in the morning, realize that
you are in school. You don‚Äôt have to drive anywhere, you‚Äôre already
there. And that the universe is literally helping to assist you into
having experiences that will bring things up for you, so that you can
choose to look at them differently ‚Äì thereby, discovering the great power
within you, the freedom within you, to choose what you want to perceive,
to elicit only what you want to feel. So again, that even if nails are
being driven through the hands, you finally are liberated in the power
to choose Love, and, therefore, to overcome this world.</p>

<p>Having said this, understand then, that each of your days is a blessing
and a gift, <em>if</em> you use it from the full commitment to awakening. Your
day is chock full of a million opportunities to discover a deeper Truth.
Therefore, never feel that the purpose of your life must be something
other than what you‚Äôre involved in. For remember what we spoke of
earlier: You are literally creating everything you choose, and nothing
is forced upon you.</p>

<p>And now we‚Äôre going to take that thought just a little deeper for a
moment, because it literally means that if you have decided you want to
awaken, it means you have already called to yourself every experience
that can truly best serve your awakening. And the friends and the
family, the people you have relationships with, are those who likewise
can best gain from the experiences elicited through your relationships.
It means that right here, and right now, you‚Äôre already demonstrating
the power that you‚Äôre seeking ‚Äî the power to truly choose to awaken, and
to command the whole of Creation to serve you in that awakening.</p>

<p>Therefore, when you awaken in each of your mornings, look around. Who‚Äôs
that person sleeping next to you? They are your perfect companion. They
are a messenger of God. And just behind all of that, you see, because
your mind is resting right next to the Mind of God, when you first said
it as a soul, ‚ÄúI want to awaken, I want to go home,‚Äù the Father answered
your prayer and began to send the thought through your spirit and
through your soul to your conscious mind,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know how to direct you home. Give up this career and start that one.
Move from this location to that location.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you began to feel all manner of impulses. You began to read
different books. You began to do different things. You met someone and
fell in love. All by accident? Hardly!</p>

<p>So, the very thought that you would claim as your own, from which you
have created the world of your own personal experience, is also,
literally, the <em>result</em> of your prayer to awaken. And the Father is
creating ‚Äî assisting you to create ‚Äî just those experiences as stepping
stones that carry you from where you are to where God is. The result is
that your ordinary daily life is the most perfect ashram you could ever
be within. It is the Holy City to which it is wise to make <em>pilgrimage</em>
every day, which means to bring awareness and commitment to exactly what
you are experiencing, to be thankful for it, to bless it, to embrace it,
to be vigilant, to be mindful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is this moment teaching me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having given that, then, as background and foundation, remember that you
do not experience anything that is called an ‚Äúordinary moment.‚Äù In each
and every moment, <em>extraordinary</em> things are occurring. Extraordinary
things are occurring in which the whole of the Universe is <em>conspiring</em> ‚Äî
which means to ‚Äúbreathe together‚Äù ‚Äî the Universe is conspiring with you
to awaken you, to heal you. Trust it! Love it! That these things are
true ‚Äî and I assure you that they are ‚Äî it means that <em>your life</em>, the
very life you are living, is <em>equal</em> in power and majesty and
effectiveness as any life that has ever been lived. It means that <em>your
very life is equal to the one that I lived</em>. For it is bringing you home,
as my life was my pathway home to God.</p>

<!-- Track t9 -->

<p>And so, to build on what we shared earlier, the third axiom or principle
could be encapsulated in this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not live any ordinary moments. With each breath, my experiences are
the stepping stones laid before me of God, to guide me home. Therefore,
I will bring awareness to each moment and allow it to teach me how to
forgive, how to embrace, how to love and, therefore, how to live fully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your ordinary moments, a thousand times each day, you‚Äôll be
confronted by opportunities to be disturbed. [laughs] Hmm! And in that
very same moment, you are being given the blessing of the opportunity to
choose peace, to remember to cultivate a perception of your brother or
sister that is a perception birthed out of the Christ Mind, not the
egoic mind. Forgiveness, then, can be practiced diligently. And you
won‚Äôt need to look too far. You will not need to make a pilgrimage to
some far city. You do not need to go sit in a cave in the mountains
somewhere to discover the way to God. It is all around you, because you
can only be where you have decreed to be. And you have decreed to be
there because you, as a soul, truly want nothing more than to awaken.
And your life, your life just as it is unfolding, moment to moment, is
meant for you.</p>

<p>If this is true, and I assure you that it is, the way to God can only be
found in your willingness to embrace and live <em>fully</em> the very life that
is within you, that unfolds through you with each moment. To live
without fear, to go forward, to indeed, trust, to embrace the very power
and the majesty that is the <em>seed</em>, the <em>soil</em>, the <em>ground</em> from which your
life‚Äôs experience is unfolding. It is precious! It is extraordinary! It
is blessed! And it is given you of God! Would you not embrace the
blessing of your life, and sanctify it to keep it holy, and to, indeed,
draw the line and recognize that your life is worthy of your respect? It
doesn‚Äôt matter what anybody else thinks. It matters what <em>you</em> think.</p>

<p>Beloved friends, your life ‚Äî <em>your life</em> ‚Äî is your way home! If you do not
live it fully, how can you ever arrive home? Therefore, fear not your
greatness. Fear not the power that comes from embracing your life and
claiming its value. Live it <em>full out</em> with every bit of <em>passion</em> you can
muster! Embrace every second of it! Every time you wash your dish and
your cup after breakfast, look upon these things and go,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My God! This is my life! This is my pathway home! And I am going to live
it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, precious friends, in this way, you will come to forgive yourself
of the judgments you have made. For who among you has not known the
feeling of saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God, my life just isn‚Äôt worth very much. I‚Äôll never be like so-and-so
down the street. And I‚Äôll never have enough money. And not enough people
are going to know me. And when will my work ever get out as big as that
person‚Äôs work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Ä¶etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p>

<p>But I say unto you, every time you‚Äôve judged yourself, you have <em>weakened</em>
yourself. Every time you have judged yourself or another, you have
slipped down the mountain another notch, when your desire is to be at
the summit.</p>

<!-- Track t10 -->

<p>Understanding these things, then, let us look more closely at
forgiveness. How does it work? What really occurs when you forgive? <em>You
are a conduit of energy.</em> To the degree that the conduit is in perfect
working order, the energy can flow so radiantly that the conduit
actually becomes <em>transparent</em>. That is, it no longer blocks. There is no
barrier or limit to the Light. When you judge, it is as though you
contracted, you made the walls of the conduit smaller, just like
building up rust in your pipes. And the flow becomes less and less. As
you forgive judgments, it is as though the rust in the pipes were
dissolving. It is as though the walls of the pipe, that are carrying the
liquid of God‚Äôs Love, begin to expand and become thinner and thinner and
more transparent. Judgment is contraction. Forgiveness is relaxation,
and peace, and trust, and faith.</p>

<p>Forgiveness allows the spaciousness within your consciousness to grow.
For when you look upon the thief that has broken into your home and say,
‚ÄúI forgive you,‚Äù you are decreeing the opposite of what you‚Äôve learned.
You are decreeing that nothing can be taken from you of any value. You
are decreeing that judgment is the opposite of what you want, and it
will cause you to feel the opposite of how you want to feel. You are
decreeing your power to perceive differently. You are, therefore,
<em>healing yourself</em>.</p>

<p>And if you ever want to come home, you‚Äôre going to have to become very,
very <em>divinely selfish</em>. You‚Äôre going to have to become so selfish that
<em>you will not tolerate judgment in yourself</em> ‚Äî of anyone or anything.
Because you will begin to recognize that every little act catapults you
to the other side of the Universe from where you want to be. It causes
the very cellular structure (if you could see this, you would never
judge again) ¬†.¬†. when you judge, even the cells of your body go crazy.
They vibrate in a completely dissonant way. And there is contraction.
The fluids do not move through the cells. The nutrients do not become
transported or delivered to the cells. The waste matter isn‚Äôt processed
properly. Everything gets clogged up, and there is dis-ease.</p>

<p>Therefore, beloved friends, understand well that judgment is not
something to take lightly. Should you, then, judge yourself if you‚Äôve
noticed you‚Äôve been in judgment? No. That‚Äôs a judgment in itself. Only
Love can heal. Therefore, when you know you‚Äôve judged, go,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ah, yes! That‚Äôs that energy. I recognize that cloud that has just passed
through the field of my awareness. But, I can choose again.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Track t11 -->

<p>So, how does this work? If in your ‚Äúordinary‚Äù daily life ‚Äî that we now
know is not ordinary at all ‚Äî if you detect that you have been in
judgment of someone or some thing, recognize that that judgment is still
with you. It‚Äôs a present thing, even though you may have enacted it five
minutes ago, or fifty-five years ago, or ten lifetimes ago. When you
notice it, or bring awareness to it, you have made it a very present
thing. So it‚Äôs right there in front of you to be undone. And that‚Äôs what
you need to focus on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I‚Äôm going to choose again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Know you the experience of looking back in your life, and suddenly
seeing a scene in which <em>now</em> you know you behaved selfishly from ego;
that you were manipulative or cunning or hurtful? Or you recognize,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My God, I was really in judgment of that person. Ah! Ooo! If only I
could go back and undo it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Know you that feeling? I say unto you, you <em>can</em>, because everything is
<em>present</em>. There is no such thing as past and future, there is only <em>now</em>.
So when you have that thought or that memory, it‚Äôs coming to you for a
<em>very specific reason</em>. As a soul, you are learning about forgiveness and
how to undo the effects of your previous choices. And so, it is being
presented to you, yet again, that you might make a new choice.</p>

<p>So when that old memory comes, stay with it. Look at it. Recognize how
judgment worked at that time. And then say to that person and or that
event,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I judge you not. I extend forgiveness to myself for what I have created.
I embrace you, and I love you. And I free you to be yourself. And I
bless you with the Blessing of Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then see that image or that memory begin to gently dissolve into Light,
until there is no trace of it left. And be done with it. <br />
And right away the mind says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, yes, but when I kicked that little boy in the shins when I was
four years old, just to watch him scream .¬†.¬†. he‚Äôs not here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Isn‚Äôt he?</em> The <em>body</em> is not here, but the body is not quite the soul. And
all minds are <em>joined</em>. It means that where you extend forgiveness within
the consciousness, within your emotional field, to another, whether they
be physically present or not, you <em>are</em> extending to them exactly what you
could extend to them if they were physically in front of you. Because,
you see, even if they were, they still have to receive it, don‚Äôt they?
They still have <em>their</em> choice to make ‚Äî whether to accept your
forgiveness, or to remain in judgment of <em>you</em>. And that‚Äôs their issue,
not yours.</p>

<p>Understand then, that you are dealing with <em>consciousness</em>. You are not a
physical being, you are Spirit. And you are intimately linked with all
minds and all times. Therefore, forgiveness of another can occur anytime
you decide that it can occur. Anyone you‚Äôve ever believed has wronged
you, can be forgiven by you, in this very moment. Anytime you‚Äôve judged
another and, therefore, been in judgment of yourself, you can undo that
in the very present moment, <em>simply by making a different choice</em>.</p>

<!-- Track t12 -->

<p>Rest assured, you will continue to project upon others what remains
unhealed, unforgiven within yourself. Each time you react to another,
you are being given a sign that there‚Äôs some kind of energy that‚Äôs been
presented to your awareness that you have not forgiven within yourself.
If someone is critical, and that pushes your buttons every time they‚Äôre
critical, rest assured, you have not healed that part of your own
beingness ‚Äî that part of your own experience of being critical of
others. Whether it‚Äôs occurring now, or whether it seems to be a pattern
that you have interrupted and no longer do, you‚Äôve still not <em>forgiven
yourself</em> for having identified with that energy.</p>

<p>Use your ordinary experience, then, in each day to observe what pushes
your buttons. And if you will stay with it ‚Äî and in just a moment we
will give you a very simple technique for doing so ‚Äî if you can stay
with it, it will reveal to you the energies that are in need of your
forgiveness.</p>

<p>The technique is quite simple. As you go through your day, observe when
you feel as though you are in contraction. Are the muscles of the body
tight? Is the breath very shallow? Does your voice become faster or
louder when you speak about some energy in someone else? That is a sign
that you need to do healing within yourself. When you recognize that
these kinds of signs are going on ‚Äî in other words, life has presented
you with an opportunity to be disturbed ‚Äî that is a sign that there is
something that requires healing.</p>

<p>So therefore, count it a blessing if you feel disturbed. Turn your
awareness from what you think is causing the disturbance and remember
the first axiom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am the source of my experience. I‚Äôm feeling disturbed. What is it in
me that needs to be healed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Begin to breathe deeply with the body and rhythmically. Let the body
soften and relax, and ask,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is it within this person‚Äôs energy that is really pushing my button?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you will see it right away:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, they‚Äôre so critical. Criticism pushes my buttons. Where have I been
critical of others?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it might hit you right away:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I‚Äôm being critical because they‚Äôre critical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or memories will come back, distasteful memories, if you‚Äôre judging
them. Let them come back. Continue to breathe and relax. Look upon that
energy of being critical. <em>Honor it. Love it.</em> For it is a creation. It is
your creations coming back to you, that you might <em>embrace</em> them and
<em>transform</em> them. And in that example, just stay with it. Look at it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ah! Being critical. Yes, I can sure be critical. I‚Äôve been that way in
the past. I know that energy very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look upon a scene in your memory in which <em>you</em> have been the one being
critical. Look upon it with deep honesty and sincerity, and say to
yourself,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I forgive me for being critical. I forgive my judgment of myself. I
choose to teach only Love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watch that image disappear from your mind, dissolve from your mind. And
bring it back to the present moment and that person that just pushed
your button. Again, you don‚Äôt need to say anything to them at all,
although you might. But, within yourself, forgive them for allowing the
energy of being critical to temporarily make a home in their mind. And
merely ask the Holy Spirit to replace your perception with the Truth.
Ask to see the innocent Light within them.</p>

<p>As you cultivate this, you‚Äôll become very, very good at it. You‚Äôll be
able to do it that fast [snaps his fingers]. And once you begin to see
the Light in them, you can ask the Holy Spirit,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is this critical energy in them masking? What are they really
crying out for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then you will feel compassion. For it will be revealed to you why
they are hurting inside. And, lo and behold, instead of being
reactionary with them, you just might be compassionate. Your choice of
words, your own behavior might turn out to be different than you could
have ever imagined. And yet, <em>through you</em> will be channeled exactly what
serves <em>them</em>.</p>

<!-- Track t13 -->

<p>When I was being nailed to the cross, there was, indeed, one who raised
the mallet to strike the nail. And as he raised the mallet, his eyes met
mine, for just a moment. And I did exactly what I‚Äôve described to you. I
first remembered, and by this time I had mastered this, so that it was
done very quickly. I asked,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How have I ever wanted to drive a nail through someone else?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I remembered my murderous thoughts. I forgave myself and brought my
attention back to that one, and asked only to see the Light in him. And
I asked,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is it that this action is mirroring to me? What is it masking
within him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I saw that one‚Äôs soul, and I loved that one‚Äôs soul. And I felt
compassion for that one. And in that moment ‚Äî mark my words ‚Äî in that
moment of eye contact, that one got it!</p>

<p>Because my energy was different, it created the space in which that soul
could make a new choice. And that soul saw suddenly the entirety of its
experience, and realized that if it allowed that mallet to fall upon the
nail, it would be a decision to choose to continue being nothing more
than a doormat for other people‚Äôs perceptions. And in that very instant,
that soul decided to follow a path that would lead to sovereign mastery,
and never again to be a pawn of any government, or any group, or any
faction, or anyone. He dropped the mallet from his hand ‚Äî this was a
Roman soldier ‚Äî stood up, and walked away, and disappeared.</p>

<p>That one has gone on to become a Master that is known by literally
thousands of beings. He is not in physical form. This one visits many,
teaches many. This one, indeed, incarnated perfect mastery, and
therefore, transcended the world. And it all began as the result of <em>my</em>
desire to teach only Love. And now, we have a very good friendship.</p>

<p>So you see, you may not know how powerful your choice for healing is.
You may not really see how deeply and profoundly it will affect you, as
you go on being a creator ‚Äî and you go on forever. And you could never
possibly know what fruits will be born from that tree in the life of
another. But because all minds are joined, when <em>you</em> choose healing,
through forgiveness, you literally create the space in which the <em>other</em>
can also heal their life.</p>

<p>Let no moment, then, be wasted. See nothing as ordinary. And see not the
perceptions taught to you of the world be justified within yourself. But
be you wholly committed to rooting up and out of your beingness <em>anything</em>
that is unlike the Love of Christ. Think not that I am the only one that
can love this way ‚Äî it is not true. You are here to love as I learned to
love. Why? Because you <em>are</em> that Love. And everything else is just a
smoke screen.</p>

<!-- Track t14 -->

<p>Forgiveness is <em>necessary</em>. Forgiveness is a skill and an art that will
pay you dividend upon dividend upon dividend upon dividend. It will
never cease in paying you. Each moment in which you choose forgiveness,
you have literally saved yourself a thousand years of suffering! Whoo!
And I mean that about as literally as one can mean it. In short, every
act of forgiveness is a miracle that shortens the need for experience in
this dimension. And when you find yourself in a situation that you
believe is too big, rest assured it is because something big has finally
come to the surface to be healed within you, so that more power can
shine forth through you, because you‚Äôve reached the place where you‚Äôre
ready for it. More of Christ can be lived.</p>

<p>It is very, very important to let each day be sufficient unto itself.
That is, when you end your day, always truly <em>end it</em>. And do not take
four hours of ritual. You can do it within one breath. As you take a
deep breath, as you rest your head upon the pillow, look upon the whole
day, embrace it with your consciousness, and as you let your breath go
out, say within your consciousness,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I release and forgive this day. It has been perfect. And it is done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let it go, just let it go. Why? Because if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll just bring
it with you. Know you that experience? And for three weeks later you‚Äôre
going,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh gosh, why did I make that decision three weeks ago? If I only would
have made a different decision, this wouldn‚Äôt have happened, that
wouldn‚Äôt have happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs probably true. But the point is, now, three weeks later, you‚Äôre
still hitting yourself over the head by bringing the past with you. And
you miss the glory of the present. You‚Äôve all heard that a thousand
times, because it‚Äôs the Truth.</p>

<p>Consciousness is a very subtle and powerful thing. <em>You cannot help but
create.</em> Remember the goal this year is to learn to <em>deliberately create</em>
with perfect mastery. Therefore, look upon the things of the day and
say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is very good. And it is finished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let each night, when you rest your head upon the pillow and you know you
are about to go off to sleep, be just like God was in the story, your
Biblical story of creation, in which it is written that on the seventh
day, God rested. God was finished, in a sense, within the story. And
have that same quality at the end of each of your days. If you‚Äôre
carrying some kind of emotional reaction because of something someone
said or did, or whatever, or something you said or did, <em>practice
forgiveness</em> before you sleep. Because if you don‚Äôt, you will keep
experiencing the conflicted energies during your dream states. And
communication between you and the other one, who has not yet been
forgiven, will keep on going on until that forgiveness is complete
within you.</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense to you, because it‚Äôs <em>very</em> important. Time should
never be taken frivolously. Play with it, yes, but play with it out of
<em>consciousness</em>, out of <em>clarity</em>, out of recognizing that there is no such
thing as an <em>idle thought</em>. Each thought creates a world of experience for
you. And you are worthy of experiencing Heaven.</p>

<!-- Track t15 -->

<p>We will have much more to say about forgiveness as we begin to plummet
the depths of what is discovered as you practice forgiveness
seventy-times-seven times. It takes you deeper and deeper into the very
mechanics of consciousness itself ‚Äî the very mechanics of creation.
Forgiveness. Put it at the top of your list until you know how perfectly
forgiven you are. Be you, therefore, vigilant against denying what is
still in need of forgiveness within you. For what you deny, you will
project. And each projection is a hurtful act to yourself. Also to the
other, of course, but to yourself.</p>

<p>So! We will let that be enough for now. There is much that has been said
in this hour that needs to be listened to again, and yet again, so that
the awareness begins to truly grasp how <em>important</em>, and how <em>powerful</em>
forgiveness is. You will reach a place where you absolutely <em>delight</em> in
going through your day expressing forgiveness, like a wave emitting
itself from the ocean of your consciousness, even if nobody is doing
anything. Forgiveness, itself, becomes a delightful energy to live
within.</p>

<p>Therefore, indeed, beloved friends, forgive you well <em>yourself</em>, and you
have forgiven Christ. And when Christ is forgiven, Christ will arise and
make His home in your heart, and in your mind, and even in the cells of
your body. And you will know what it means to walk in this world, yet
not be of the world. And when you look in the mirror, you will say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behold, the Savior appears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will not be egoic arrogance that says it, but the recognition of what
is true always:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am my Father‚Äôs Child, and I am sent into this world to bring Light to
it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So! Be you, therefore, at peace. Practice forgiveness well, until it
becomes like taking a breath. And you will discover power that you
didn‚Äôt know could exist, and a freedom whose taste is sweet above honey.</p>

<p>I forgive you [laughs]. Not because I‚Äôve judged you, but because I know
the <em>blessing</em> that forgiveness brings to <em>me</em>. Forgiveness is something I
perfected as a man. Perfect it within yourself, as well, and you will
know the Glory of Christ.</p>

<p>Be you, therefore, at peace, beloved friends.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
