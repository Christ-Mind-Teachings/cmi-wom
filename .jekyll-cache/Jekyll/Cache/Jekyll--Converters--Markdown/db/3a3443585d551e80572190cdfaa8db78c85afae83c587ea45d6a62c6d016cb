<p>Jeshua, I’m reminded of our conversation about co–creating Christs
a few months ago, and I wonder if you would extend that conversation
somewhat tonight?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>

<p>Yes. Get – on – with – it.</p>

<p>Think you could make that any clearer?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>All that you need is given, right here, right now. All power under
Heaven and Earth resides within the depth of your consciousness, which
is that which literally is creating what you see around you and what you
feel within you. Therefore, claim that power, own it, take it into your
being, and never, never again allow yourself to deny that you are the
One, the One Creation of God. And unto you nothing is impossible. Does
that help clarify?</p>

<p>You’re wonderful!</p>

<p>I am only yourself. Hmm.</p>
