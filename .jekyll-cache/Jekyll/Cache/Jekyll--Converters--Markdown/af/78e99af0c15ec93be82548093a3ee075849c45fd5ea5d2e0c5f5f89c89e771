<p>Is there a force outside of God?</p>

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>

<p>Just you. I well do understand the direction of your question. There can
be nothing outside of God, and what is unreal does not and cannot exist.
Yet, you have the power within the infinite freedom of God to <em>believe a
perception</em> that there is a force outside of or other than God. Just as
you have believed that you are separate from God. â€˜Tis an optical
delusion of consciousness. It is a dream of a child sleeping in a
meadow, in whom no change has truly occurred. That which is called Satan
cannot exist or have any power, save in that mind that allows it, and
who <em>gives</em> that power <em>to</em> it. For did I not ask you to speak unto one,
could the devil withstand your love? And did it not bring that one to
silence? In other words, Love healsâ€Šâ€”â€Šbecause Love is real. And when you
step from fear into Love, where did the boogeyman go?</p>
