I"±$<p><strong>LOVE</strong>. It <em>does</em> ride on every breath we breathe, and over the course of
this experience with ]eshua, I have learned that Love <em>does</em> desire to be
heard with every single spoken word. Jeshua is a master of it, but his
mastery does not place Him above us. He will wait patiently, perhaps
perceived as a little ahead of us, until we recognize that what awaits
us, what has <em>always</em> awaited us, is the choice for Love. It is a choice
in which all other options collapse, a choice which, in the final
analysis, is actually revealed to our awakened minds as the <em>choiceless
choice.</em> Has there ever been any other viable option?</p>

<p>Love can seem so frightening! It requires the deep recognition that the
past is <em>passed away.</em> It requires that we come home to <em>this</em> present
moment, relinquishing our need to be right, our penchant for blaming,
and above all, claiming complete responsibility for everything we think,
feel, say, and do. It also must come to mean that we accept
responsibility <em>for the world we see.</em> If the world isn‚Äôt changing, we
must not be changing!</p>

<p><em>The spoken word.</em> Not merely verbal communication, for <em>we are the thought
of Love in form.</em> Our every gesture, then, ‚Äúspeaks‚Äù to the world of what
we are choosing to lay up as our treasures. But more than this, our
every gesture speaks also to us, whispering what our choice has been,
and <em>offering the perfect freedom to choose again</em>.</p>

<p>Together, we stand now on the threshold of something new, something
unparalleled, at least in known history. The pulse of change is
everywhere felt. Technology is making the world
a very small place, indeed. In an instant, the experience of a brother
or sister living on the other side of the globe is brought into our
living room, their voices compelling us to stretch our hearts wide, to
accept them, too, as true family. Can <em>we</em> love enough? No, I think not.
But, thank <em>God</em>, Love itself is enough, for surely God <em>is</em> Love, waiting
on our welcome.</p>

<p>In nearly twenty years, as this PathWay we now call the Way of Mastery
has unfolded under His meticulous guidance, I have seen time and time
again the undeniable truth that there really is no order of difficulty
in the miracles Love can bring forth, when we simply join our hearts and
hands and offer Love the tiny bit of willingness it takes to suspend our
judgments and learn anew. Oh, yes, Love is enough. Beneath every denied
feeling, beneath every anger and hurt we cling to, Love waits to heal us
so deeply that it seems the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù was never there, as though we
slept for a while, and dreamt dreams of loss, of weakness, of
unworthiness, of guilt, of shame, of unreality. What joy to awaken!</p>

<p>We <em>are</em> awakening. We ‚Äì you and I and everyone ‚Äì have been together as
long as time has been. We have dreamt together every dream unlike Love,
and the choiceless choice comes to present itself yet again. We are the
makers of the world we see, and this recognition can seem to paralyze
us, depress us, or immobilize us, until we realize that it is only an
expression of the thoughts we have insisted on maintaining as real! We
are free now, free to <em>choose again</em>.</p>

<p>Jeshua has been an enigma for 2,000 years. That is a long time to be
famous, especially without building an empire, writing any books, or
being allowed as a subject of study in public schools. The guy doesn‚Äôt
have any movie credits to his name, nor did He ever invent anything. But
He did accept the choiceless choice to <em>live</em> the reality of Love. And
that has made all the difference ‚Äì for Him, and for everyone who has
ever opened their heart just a little to Him. He has often said that He
has waited long for <em>this</em> time to be present on the Earth. A time when a
timeless Truth can be breathed as an idea into minds and hearts, and
spread rapidly and completely around the world. I say ‚Äúbreathed‚Äù because
the time for dogma, for preaching, is behind us. To <em>breathe</em> the truth
first requires that we take it deeply into ourselves, literally with
every breath, then offer it to whoever is in front of us, literally with
each outward breath, as though bathing them in what is beyond words. We
can invite them, in an atmosphere of safety, to breathe with us. It can
become a circle, a dance, of receiving and giving, giving and receiving.
Are we willing to initiate such sharing?</p>

<p>When we make the choiceless choice for Love, right <em>here</em> and right <em>now</em>,
wherever we are, we join with others all over the world who are also
choosing to awaken. Our every loving gesture literally uplifts the
world, because it must necessarily affect the collective mind of
mankind.</p>

<p>One of my favorite quotes is from a Jewish teacher, Maimonidies. What he
asks is perhaps the only question we need answer. While it points to our
responsibility, it also points to the immeasurable power that lives
<em>equally</em> within each of us, and will shine forth as we unlearn our fear
of it. The question is this:</p>

<p class="center indent omit">If not NOW, when?<br />
If not YOU, who?</p>

<p>With Jeshua as loving brother and guide, we have learned that the
choiceless choice is the inevitable recognition that the <em>when</em> is now,
and the <em>who</em> is us. We have also learned that awakening is not about some
ephemeral aloofness masquerading as transcendence, in which every
challenge and every unwanted feeling is explained away as an illusion.
Rather, awakening is a <em>correction</em>, a wiping clean of the slate of
learned perceptions, so that life, which is but Love extending itself to
embrace creation, can finally be <em>lived</em> and not merely survived. It is
not an end, but a beginning. My friend, Michael Stillwater, calls it
‚Äúlanding with your feet on the planet.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeam me up, Scottie‚Äù is <em>not</em> what our gentle brother teaches, nor lives
for. Love does not seek escape, but serves. While the ego cries out,
‚ÄúBut what is in it for me?‚Äù the awakened heart asks simply, ‚ÄúHow can I
help?‚Äù‚Ä¶ then lets Love be the guide.</p>

<p>Alan Cohen wrote that ‚ÄúJeshua would probably agree that we have had
enough students, and it is time for more masters.‚Äù I wholeheartedly
agree. He has never asked to be worshipped, only to be joined. Love will
prevail in the end, if only because it requires great energy to resist
it, and that resistance will finally exhaust itself. We learn either
through joy or through pain, but we <em>will</em> learn. The direction of the
wise choice seems obvious enough.</p>

<p>Jeshua once stopped me in my tracks by saying that ‚Äúthe truths of the
world are <em>diametrically opposed</em> to the Reality of the Kingdom.‚Äù That
means that everything we have been taught is the exact opposite of what
is real! The world has taught us that we must know where we are going
before starting the journey. We must know what we are going to get, how
it is going to affect us, and then decide whether or not to launch our
ship. We need to make sure we have our parachute in order before we
jump. <em>But exactly the opposite is true</em>!</p>

<p>I believe in you. I believe that you are intimately united with the
Source of Life, and that Life longs to be lived through <em>you</em>; that you
have every right to set aside the ways of this world, where the laws of
chaos, distrust, and fear seem to rule. If you jump, you will find your
parachute. To all of you who have jumped, and to the growing number of
us who are now moving to the edge, I extend our gratitude to you for
being willing to join with everyone now choosing to bring Heaven to
Earth.</p>

<p>Well, there. Now that it is 5 a.m., I can crawl back under the covers.
Something more needed to be shared to complete this book. I see now that
Jeshua, throughout <em>The Way of the Servant</em>, was both correcting our
collective misconceptions about who we really are, while also asking
Maimonides‚Äô question. A question waits on an answer, and I could not let
this fourth edition go to press without answering it. Here, then, is my
final offering to you. May we join together to grow, heal, and push the
limits of awakening. May we join to envision a planet healed and a
humanity at peace, and to do all we can to share who we really are ‚Äì
radical, ecstatic spirit ‚Äì together with what we can discover that is
truly helpful with those who will be drawn to us!</p>

<p class="quote">Heaven on Earth.</p>

<p>Jeshua refers to this as the ‚Äúadamic process‚Äù. ‚ÄòDam‚Äô in his native
Aramaic language, refers to nature, or the bodymind itself. ‚ÄòA‚Äô
(pronounced Aaahh) is the first letter of the name for God he used the
most: ‚ÄòAlaha‚Äô, and signifies the unlimited source we have come to call
‚ÄúGod‚Äù.</p>

<p>Thus, ‚Äúa‚Äù seeks to penetrate, suffuse, and move through ‚Äúdam‚Äù, as it
seeks in the great cycle of evolution to manifest what has not yet
completed its full birthing: ‚ÄúAdam‚Äù the ‚Äòfirst man‚Äô of the bible! For we
are all part of this great birthing as the fulness of real humanity.</p>

<p class="quote">Can there be a greater adventure? <br />
Can there be anything more worthy of our being?</p>

<p>Streams of joy!</p>
