<p>What is the interplay between playing out strong attachments,
habits, compulsions, addictions, in order to let them go with gentleness
and understanding, or using discipline and self control to end these
attachments?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>

<p>Discipline is not a rigidity or resistance <em>against</em>. Genuine
discipline is merely a product, if you will, of the Mind. <em>Genuine
discipline</em> requires only that you bring your attention to precisely what
is true in any given moment of your experience, without judgment.
Discipline is the vigilance of awareness and the decision to <em>be</em> the
presence of Love.</p>

<p>The answer seems simple and short and to the point, but if you will
contemplate it, even if you will sit in your meditation and write the
answer out slowly, so that you watch the letters of the words appear on
your plain white paper, and as you give yourself permission to be
patient, not in a hurry, more will be revealed to you. And yet, the
essence has, indeed, been given. Enjoy the discipline of contemplating
the answer.</p>
