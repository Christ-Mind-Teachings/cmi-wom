<p class="top"><span class="dropcaps">N</span>ow is the<br />
end come.<br />
We are returned<br />
to the ancient<br />
beginning.
</p>

<p>Here,<br />
where Truth is restored,<br />
we look with gentleness<br />
upon the world.</p>

<hr />

<p class="top"><span class="dropcaps">Y</span>ou are here only to be<br />
truly helpful.<br />
Yet<br />
you do not know<br />
what needs to be done.
</p>

<p>Would you know<br />
your Father‚Äôs will for you?</p>

<p>Precious friend,<br />
open the eyes of your Self;<br />
it will not be hidden<br />
from you.</p>

<hr />

<p class="top"><span class="dropcaps">W</span>here does the
servant go,<br /> awakened to the eternal?<br /> ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù<br /> comes the
quiet reply.  </p>

<hr />

<p class="top"><span class="dropcaps">B</span>ecause <em>you</em><br />
are awake <em>here</em><br />
and your sister<br />
is awake <em>here</em>,<br />
though bodies are<br />
seemingly separate,<br />
there is not two,<br />
but one.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="top"><span class="dropcaps">P</span>ray<br />
fast,<br />
meditate.<br />
Journey into the silent places<br />
of your precious Earth,<br />
for she alone is your mother.
</p>

<p>Sing,<br />
laugh,<br />
dance,<br />
play.</p>

<p>Drink the first rays of a new dawn.<br />
Touch the dark velvet<br />
of a moonless night.<br />
Feel the grasses against your skin,<br />
and stand beneath<br />
the cascading waterfall.</p>

<p>Give but one day of your week<br />
to silence,<br />
eating only the Light<br />
from your Father.</p>

<hr />

<p class="top"><span class="dropcaps">S</span>mile often,<br />
and remember<br />
you have chosen to come,<br />
<em>here</em>.<br />
Look around you,<br />
and bless the place you are.<br />
Do these things often,<br />
in remembrance of me.
