I"·ê<p>Now, we begin.</p>

<p>And indeed, once again, greetings unto you, beloved and holy friends.
<em>Indeed, greetings to you, beloved and holy friends.</em> If you understand
the meaning of this greeting, if you comprehend the <em>depth</em> of each term
used, already you know all there is to know. And you are well prepared
to extend the Love of God, forever.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Indeed</em>‚Äù means simply that there are no other options. ‚Äú<em>Greetings</em> unto
you,‚Äù salutations to that one created of the Father before all things,
for I bow down before your radiance. Greetings unto you, ‚Äú<em>beloved</em>‚Äù and
holy Child of God! Indeed, beloved of God. Indeed, beloved of every
molecule in your physical universe. Indeed, loved of your Holy Mother,
this precious Earth. Indeed, loved by anything you can imagine that has
ever existed or ever could exist, but that has extended itself from the
Heart and Mind of God. You are the Beloved, pure and simple. And again,
there are no options.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Holy</em>,‚Äù because you are whole ‚Äî not because you have earned that
holiness ‚Äî but because it is that which is the Truth from which you are
extended forth forever; because you are made in the image of God;
because you spring forth from the Mind of God. You are holiness <em>itself</em>,
each time you set aside the temptation to dream a useless dream and walk
this Earth as Christ.</p>

<p>Beloved and holy ‚Äú<em>friend</em>.‚Äù A friend is not one lesser than myself. A
friend is one who walks in perfect equality, with the grandest of
masters, whoever you might conceive such a master to be. A friend ‚Äî a
friend is one who chooses to look upon another and see only the Face of
Christ therein. And there is no one present in this room and, indeed,
there shall never be anyone present in the hearing of these words, that
has not already looked upon <em>me</em> and seen the Face of Christ within. And,
likewise, I look upon <em>you</em> and call you ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù</p>

<p>For when I look upon you, I see not the very momentary dreams that you
seem to think are lasting so long. I see only the radiance of that which
my Father has extended out of Love. I see only that which has neither
beginning or ending. And I see only that which knows neither birth nor
death. I see only that which has no limitations. I see only that, the
Light of which is already extended throughout all dimensions and all
universes.</p>

<p>I see only my brother and my sister. And I see not a trace of inequality
between us. And yet I do recognize that, within your dream, it appears
to you that I have gone ahead just a little bit. And at times, within
your hearts, there is a longing to follow me. And if you would but <em>heed</em>
that <em>longing</em>, if you would make that longing <em>primary</em> at all times, your
own <em>desire</em> will bring you wholly to where I am. And you will laugh when
you discover that you haven‚Äôt moved an inch ‚Äî that where I am is where
you are, and where you are is in eternity, and not in time; that where
you are is in the place of your birth: <em>the Mind of God</em>. This is the only
thing that is true and it is true always. This is the only reality that
you genuinely possess. Therefore, indeed, I call you <em>friend</em>. For well do
I see that you are as I am, and therefore, <em>indeed, greetings unto you,
beloved and holy friends</em>.</p>

<p>So we can stop now. There is nothing else to be said. And yet the mind
races, does it not? And yet it races from the very reality that I have
just described about you. The mind races from that source as a sunbeam
to the sun. Yet, in reality, it never leaves its Source. And the very
power with which you seem to become distracted, by a momentary thought
of fear, is the same power by which you <em>will</em> awaken to your own call.</p>

<p>In Truth, there is a place within you that already knows the day and the
hour. You already know when you are going to decide to live the decision
to be awake in God, to be only the presence of Love. <em>And Love embraces
all things, allows all things, trusts all things, transcends all things.</em>
Love is never possessive. Love is never fearful. Love is simply Love.
Love cannot shine with specialness upon anyone at any time. For
specialness, itself, is a contraction, the attempt to take Love and make
it shine only on one object, only on one person, only on one being, only
within one universe.</p>

<p>Whenever, therefore, you recognize that you have singled someone or
something out and said, ‚ÄúThey hold a greater value,‚Äù you may rest
assured that you‚Äôre not in Love at all, you are in fear. And therefore,
if that one were to leave you, where would you be? But if you are <em>in
Love</em>, as a fish within the sea, all beings can arise and pass away and
you will bless them in their journey. And you will remember that you
reside where God has placed you. And God has placed you in His Heart.
And when you choose to be <em>only</em> the presence of Love, even the dream of
loss will dissolve from your consciousness as a forest mist before the
rising sun.</p>

<p>Indeed, beloved friends, Love does wait upon your welcome. And yet you
cannot welcome Love by waiting for it to be brought <em>to</em> you by another,
not even by <em>me</em>. You cannot welcome Love by trying to scurry about to
create the environment in which you believe your preferences are being
met. You cannot welcome Love when that welcome is attached or linked to
any phenomenal thing, anything which has been birthed in time. Love can
only be welcomed where Love truly resides. And Love resides within you
as the Core and the Source of your very being.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you would know Love, know your <em>Self</em>. Embrace the Truth
about it and the Truth will set you free. Then, indeed, Love will <em>flow</em>
through you. And like the great sunlight that comes to nurture this
beloved Earth of yours, the Love that flows through you will be
<em>unimpeded</em>. It will not meet an obstacle. And you will look upon whomever
is in front of you and you will know that they are sent unto you of the
Father. They have been guided to you by the Holy Spirit because, through
you, Love can be given in a way that begins to touch the place of their
awakening. That is why you are but the servant of Love. That‚Äôs all that
Life is!</p>

<p>When you choose to surrender, to give up the game, to give up the dream
of trying to resist the Truth that is true about you always, you will
become a mere channel, a mere conduit. You will become no more a seeker,
for you will have decided to have <em>found</em>. And surrendering the last
vestige of an insane possibility of contracting away from the Truth,
when you‚Äôve given that up, Love will flow through you. But notice that
if it flows <em>through</em> you, it must first flow <em>to</em> you. Therefore, seek
always to <em>receive</em> in order to <em>give</em>. For what can you give another if you
have not yet given it to yourself?</p>

<p>How many of you have been taught to try to love, to try to do the
‚Äúright‚Äù thing, the ‚Äúgood‚Äù thing? ‚Ä¶whatever that is supposed to mean.
And yet, how many times have you gone within your secret chamber and
said, ‚ÄúI am unworthy‚Äù? And then you wonder why your attempts to join in
Love with others never seems to be quite fulfilling enough, never quite
seems to fill the cup, never quite seems to elicit the joy that you
believe could be there. For indeed, listen well, your work, if you wish
to call it that, is not to seek and find Love, ‚Äòtis merely to turn
within to discover every obstacle that you have created to its presence,
and to offer that obstacle to the great dissolver of dreams, the grace
of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>I have said unto you many times, that the greatest of gifts you can give
is this: to come wholly to the recognition that every attempt you have
made to resist being the presence of Christ has <em>failed you, miserably</em>.
No matter how many times you have tried to convince yourself that you
are unworthy, yet does the universe find a way to love you. No matter
how many times you have tried to lock yourself into the space and volume
of a body, it hasn‚Äôt succeeded. And at death, you have remembered and
been confronted with the <em>radiance of your unlimitedness</em>. Therefore,
indeed, the greatest of gifts you can give another is to be one who has
rescinded the need to insist on the insanity of fear.</p>

<p><em>Fearlessness</em> is the primary characteristic of mastery. And mastery is
not having great power to make things happen. Mastery is only the
recognition that what is true is true always and there is no other
choice. Free will does not mean that you have the right to believe that
you can succeed at being other than what God created you to be. Having
free will does not mean that you can elect not to take the only
curriculum that Life is offering to you in every moment. It means only
that you <em>do</em> have the right to put it off yet another day. And each time
you put it off, you slumber in your suffering.</p>

<p>But when you elect to take the only curriculum that matters, when you
elect to use the power of your free will to say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, from this moment on, I will no longer tolerate error in myself. No
more games, no more dreams. I am committed to being only the presence of
Love, for that is the Truth of who I am. It matters not the opinions of
others who are yet resisting that decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Ä¶ then, indeed, all things under Heaven and Earth move to support
you, to guide you to the right person, the right place, the right book,
the right sunrise, the right meadow, in order to assist you in dropping
the shackles of the obstacles to the presence of Love that you have
created as an idol and as a substitute for Love. And that is why, when
truly you pray from the depths of your soul, ‚ÄúFather, bring me home,‚Äù
you may rest assured, from that moment on, it‚Äôs okay to trust every
little thing that unfolds. For though you see it not, what you would
call the <em>angels</em> ‚Äî friends that simply don‚Äôt have bodies ‚Äî are rushing
about because you have given the command to say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, I accept your presence in my life. I turn the whole thing over.
Now, each moment is dedicated to healing and awakening the illusory
sense of separation from God that once I created in error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Love! In how many ways have you sought it? Hmm! Can you count the ways?
Hmm! Would you dare to try to count each little pebble of sand on the
beaches of your planet? For rest assured, each and every soul has
already tried to seek out Love in that many ways, if not more. You have
sought it in a million forms in which you <em>already knew</em> that you <em>could
not find it</em>. All because you wanted to perpetuate the insane attempt to
try to separate yourself from God. And that is as futile as a sunbeam
trying to separate itself from the sun.</p>

<p>Indeed, beloved friends, there is only one question you need answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What am I choosing in this moment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What have I given mastery over my life unto: what perception, what
thought, what feeling? (since feeling merely flows from the thought or
the perception you have chosen). What behavior, what action am I
choosing in this moment and does it express the reality of my beingness?
Am I being busy extending Love, or am I busying myself fearfully trying
to grasp at what I think can give me Love so that I don‚Äôt lose it?</p>

<p>Look well, then, upon your parents, and your siblings, and your mates,
and your friends. Not one of them, <em>not one of them</em>, holds the power to
bring Love to you. So what are you trying to get from them? Why do you
ever insist that another ought to be conformed to what you believe you
need? It is futile, one hundred percent, absolutely, positively futile
to seek Love in relationship with anything or anyone.</p>

<p>It is, however, quite appropriate to <em>extend</em> Love in each relationship,
with everyone and everything. But the extension of that Love requires
that you have awakened to the Truth that the <em>only</em> relationship that
truly holds value is the relationship between you, as the soul, and the
Father, or God, as your Creator.</p>

<p>Imagine a light bulb in one of your fixtures, that looks out from its
little filaments and says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hmm! Well I hope the person that just walked in the door is the right
one. If I could just reach out and grab them, maybe my own light would
come on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm. Isn‚Äôt it a lot easier to simply take the cord and plug it into the
right socket? How many times are you going to insist on trying to plug
your cord into the wrong socket? Hmm?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well that one didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll try this body, I‚Äôll try this person,
I‚Äôll try this career. Hmm. Not getting very much juice from that either.
Ah! Well, there was a little juice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then you get angry because it‚Äôs not giving you enough juice, or it
gave you enough juice yesterday but not today, so it must be <em>its</em> fault.
Hmm!</p>

<p>There is one little tiny socket into which you can plug your cord. It‚Äôs
the only one that it fits in and it‚Äôs the only socket wired to bring you
the Flowing and Living Waters of Grace. And that socket dwells only
within your Heart ‚Äî not the physical heart, but that which is symbolized
by the physical heart: the <em>core of your very being</em>.</p>

<p>But how many times in each day do you check to see that the cord is
still plugged in? How many times do you remember to ask yourself,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is my commitment to Love or is my commitment to fear?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fear is the act of disconnecting your cord from the only socket that can
truly satisfy you, and running about trying to plug it in to somebody
else‚Äôs or something else‚Äôs. And I would ask you to consider this one
question, as you look upon the whole of your experience: Has it ever
worked? Can it ever work?</p>

<p>Imagine trying to hold flowing water in the palm of your hand by
squeezing the fingers together. How much are you left with? Doesn‚Äôt it
just run through the fingers, no matter how hard you try? It finds the
little holes and it flows away. You open your hand and there is not
enough left there to wet the tongue. And yet, each time you have looked
upon another ‚Äî whether parent or sibling or friend or mate or teacher or
whatever you have ‚Äî every time you‚Äôve looked upon a physical object and
tried to plug into that socket to get the juice you believe you need,
that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing. And you literally end up squeezing the life
out of the relationship itself.</p>

<p>But in Truth, when you seek first the Kingdom and plug that cord into
the socket within your heart, when you remember that you and your Father
are One, that only Love is real, that nothing else matters ‚Ä¶ and
what you‚Äôre feeling that might be speaking to you saying, ‚ÄúBut ‚Ä¶ but
‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶‚Äù is nothing more than the echo of an old
habit. And that habit can not live unless <em>you</em> feed it.</p>

<p>Therefore, feed the only habit that matters: the habit of remembering
that the Truth is true always, regardless of what is passing before your
physical eyes, and, therefore, before your mind. In all comings and
goings, in all births and deaths, in all arising and passing away of
universe after universe after universe, in the midst of a flat tire or a
sudden rainstorm, nothing ‚Äî <em>nothing</em> ‚Äî holds value except your
relationship with your Creator.</p>

<p>When you have experienced, in relationship with anyone or anything, a
moment of bliss, a moment of a peace that forever passes all
understanding, a moment of fulfillment so sweet and so sublime that no
word could touch it, much less express it, what you have experienced is
only the flow of the Love of God through you. It was not caused by that
person or thing. It was caused because, for just a moment, you stepped
out of your drama, you stepped out of your dream, and allowed the Truth
to be lived.</p>

<p>Then, of course, you tricked yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God, that was so sweet! That was the best thing I‚Äôve ever tasted. It
must have come from you. Get over here! I need you!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If ever you believe you need anything or anyone, rest assured, in that
moment you are living in delusion.</p>

<p>All you need is Love. Love fulfills all things. Love embraces all
things. Love heals all things, and Love transforms all things.
Therefore, indeed, remember well ‚Äî you, and only you, can become the
cause, if you will, of your fulfillment, of your peace, of your
completion of time. And this requires that you do nothing save remember
to establish the connection with your Creator.</p>

<p>Is it not true that what you desire most of all is Love? Is it not true
that you try, or you at least hope, that each relationship, no matter
how short, no matter what its form, that each journey, that each
undertaking will allow you the experience of peace? Is it not true that
you who find yourselves in and as a body, temporarily in time, is it not
true that the grandest of experiences you‚Äôve known have been those that
seem to flood the very cells of the body with Love, with a sublime bliss
and a peace?</p>

<p>Accept that Truth, that what you desire beyond all things is <em>the living
experience of Love</em>. And then remember that nothing you do can bring Love
to you. Nothing you do can keep Love for yourself in a form of your
choosing. Nothing you do ‚Äî <em>nothing you do</em> ‚Äî can make Love appear in the
form of your insistence.</p>

<p>But releasing the drama, releasing the dream, choosing to remember the
Truth that is true always, returning to the Kingdom within, even prior
to every breath, and reminding yourself and saying to your Creator,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want only that which is true always. Love is what I want. Love is what
You are. Love is what I receive. Love is who I am. I and my Father are
One.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, and here alone, do you discover what you seek.</p>

<p>And then you become free to walk this Earth, to be in it, but not of it
at all. And though your friends will look upon you, and still see a man
or a woman who seems to act much like themselves ‚Äì and yet, though they
see it not, Christ dwells with them. And something in them keeps
attracting them to you. They are not sure what it is. The shape of your
body? Hmm! The radiance of your eyes? ‚ÄòTis not these things. They feel
the quality of <em>Love</em>.</p>

<p>Can you imagine walking upon this Earth, this very planet upon which you
find yourselves, and no matter where you are, feeling as though every
wisp of cloud and every blade of grass and all good things under Heaven
and Earth were already residing with you, within this sphere of your
countenance? Can you imagine walking upon this Earth and sensing that
the Light from the farthest of stars that shines during the night is
already within you, that the whole of Creation was held in the palms of
your hands? Would there be room yet to convince yourself that there is
something you lack, something you need, that the restlessness you feel
must be valid?</p>

<p>In Truth, you are like one who has been given a perfect treasure, a
priceless jewel. And you have placed it into your pocket and forgotten
that you possess it. And so you run around trying to look into everybody
else‚Äôs pocket. And you‚Äôve tried to seduce certain ones to surrender so
that you can own the clothing and, therefore, try to possess the jewel
that you hope is in their pocket. But the great Truth is that you cannot
possess Love until you set it free. You cannot move into holy
relationship with anyone or anything until you give up all trace of need
to possess it.</p>

<p>When your only desire is Love, you will be willing to set anyone free,
to support them in their own journey, no matter what it is or what it
takes. And yet, you will never feel your Love waver. And if a twinge of
sadness arises because you recognize that two bodies in space are now
going to go to separate parts of the planet, as that twinge arises,
you‚Äôll recognize it as the effect of a mistaken perception. And you will
move within, to the place in which all minds are joined. And you will
remember that your fulfillment does not rest in <em>gaining</em> Love from
another but in <em>giving</em> Love to everyone.</p>

<p>If, indeed, you would know the Truth that sets you free, heed each and
every word that is being shared. And if you would taste the sweet nectar
of perfect freedom, be you, therefore, committed to replacing every
erroneous perception you‚Äôve ever made, every thought you‚Äôve ever held of
everyone and everything, to set these things aside and commit the
fullness of your energy to the simple but vigilant practice of
remembering the Truth ‚Äî even prior to every breath:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I live! ‚Äî yet not I but Christ dwells in me. Therefore, I submit and
surrender to the Truth that is true always. For my fulfillment comes
only from allowing Christ to be given to the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so, you see, the Truth is very simple. It is not complex at all. Get
out of the way, let Love live through you. And all of a sudden you will
know that, indeed, you are given all good things eternally. You will
know that Grace is reality. You will know that effortlessness is the way
of Life in the Kingdom. But effortlessness does not mean that you do not
feel, for you are in a dimension of feeling. Effortlessness does not
mean that you do not discover, that you do not deepen your ability to be
the living embodiment of Love. It does not mean that you do not
challenge yourself to learn to express Love in a way that can be heard
by another. Effortlessness means simply that you abandon the resistance
to what Love requires in each moment.</p>

<p><em>Effortlessness</em> is the way of the Kingdom. In the world, effortlessness
means that you let down the wall you have built between yourself and all
of Creation. You no longer resist the <em>lived experience of relationship</em>,
whatever it is ‚Äî relationship with a cloud, relationship with another
person, relationship with a dog or a cat, relationship with ‚Äî what you
call this ‚Äî your April 15th, when you write your grand government a
check. Hmm. Why do you not wrap it with what you call your Christmas
paper and your ribbons and send it with much Love? Hmm!</p>

<p>When you‚Äôve learned to release the barriers, the walls between yourself
and whatever is in front of you, when you open the door to what many of
you would call your <em>chakras</em> and simply allow Love to be lived through
you, when you look upon another, or another situation, or another thing,
and realize that nothing in this world has the power to hurt you,
nothing in this world has the power to take anything from you, <em>if you
remember to extend Love</em>, then you are free! And you‚Äôve transcended birth
and death. The seeker is no more and only Christ walks this Earth. And
if your commitment is, indeed, to look within and discover each and
every obstacle you have ever created to the presence of Love, why do you
resist <em>feeling</em> those things? For well has it been said to you, that on
just the other side is the very Love you seek.</p>

<p>Deny then, not, the role of <em>feeling</em> in this dimension, for <em>feeling is
everything</em>! You can‚Äôt even know the presence of God unless you feel it.
You can‚Äôt <em>think about</em> the presence of God. You can‚Äôt insist on a belief
about the presence of God. That doesn‚Äôt do it, that doesn‚Äôt fill your
cup. Feeling fills your cup. Feeling ‚Äî <em>unbridled, unblocked,
unobstructed feeling</em> ‚Äî is the doorway to that Love that sets you free!</p>

<p>Therefore, when you say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to feel this,‚Äù rest assured of
what you‚Äôre truly saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, yes. The doorway to the Kingdom of Heaven is right in front of me,
but if you think I‚Äôm going to open it, you are crazy! It‚Äôs not worth it
anyway. What is worth it, is protecting the substitute I have made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I have called it the ego, the false self, what I once described to
you as a gnat shouting at space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That! Oh, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm committed to. And I‚Äôm going to protect this
thing. Give up Heaven to protect this useless little thing? Oh, yes!
You‚Äôd better believe I‚Äôd be willing to make that sacrifice! What‚Äôs
Heaven anyway? A bunch of love stuff. Hmm! A bunch of people running
around in bliss, some of them without bodies, hanging out in
unlimitedness, fearlessness, utter fulfillment. Who needs it? Oh, but
this little gnat, this little gnat of mine. Oh! I‚Äôm going to make it
shine!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is much wisdom to look at in your funny little sayings and music
and things. How many times have you tried to make that little gnat
shine? Hmm!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everybody notice, its shining. Please, notice how great I am. I‚Äôm making
my gnat shine. Listen to my whining and my complaining and my (pardon
the expression, what you call the ‚Äúbitching‚Äù), the lamenting, the great
sadness. Oh! How grand my gnat is!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Love of God flows through a multitude of universes and
creates ‚Äî forever ‚Äî even new universes. And the Love of God doesn‚Äôt even
notice the gnat at all. No one is paying any attention. Your friends
around you don‚Äôt want to pay attention, although sometimes you corner
them and they have no choice. But those of us without bodies ‚Äî do you
really, actually think we waste our precious eternity taking your
attempt to make the gnat shine <em>seriously</em>? Indeed, because we Love you,
we give you the space, and we honor your free will to be as little and
as miserable as you wish. And we will wait until you choose to come once
again into the greatness in which you truly reside. We never withdraw
our Love from you. We simply look through your story line, because what
we wish to love is the <em>Christ</em> that dwells within you.</p>

<p>What calendar day and hour will you decide to <em>love yourself</em> as the
Father has first loved you? To truly ‚Äî to <em>truly</em> ‚Äî and once and for all,
make the decision to <em>live</em>! For until you decide <em>with</em>, and <em>for</em>, and
forever <em>from</em> the Mind of Christ, <em>life has not yet begun</em>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, my God! That‚Äôs a bit of a blow, isn‚Äôt it? Look at all the
experiences I‚Äôve had, Jeshua. How can you tell me I haven‚Äôt lived? Why,
there was this drama, then there was that drama, then there was that
drama over there. Don‚Äôt you remember seventeen lifetimes ago when I did
this and then I did that? I struggled through that one, and I‚Äôve
struggled through this one. I have lived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you‚Äôve <em>dreamed</em>.</p>

<p>Do you awaken in the morning and realize that you‚Äôve had a whole night
of dreams of receiving ribbons and trophies, and what have you, from the
world? And then say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That was very real. The trophies must be out sitting on my kitchen
table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you awaken and sit up and put your feet on the ground, you go,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ah! Shake my head a little. I was just dreaming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While you dreamt, it felt real enough. And that‚Äôs the quality I‚Äôm
speaking to here.</p>

<p>And if you wish to take this as an affront, it‚Äôs perfectly okay. It won‚Äôt
disturb my peace at all. Until you fully decide to come into Life as the
presence of Christ, as the presence of Love, to <em>own</em> each moment of your
experience as wholly self-created, for no other reason than that you
have chosen it from the perfect and infinite freedom of your Unlimited
Beingness, when you look upon all things without judgment, through the
eyes of forgiveness, when you decide to embody only the reality of Love,
no matter what anybody else is doing, <em>that is when Life begins</em>!</p>

<p>As of this date on your calendar, there have only been a handful of
beings who have <em>truly lived Life</em> upon this plane, a very small handful.
There are many of us that would just absolutely be <em>thrilled</em> if you would
join the club! And I‚Äôll let you in on a little secret: until you do, you
don‚Äôt get to graduate. You will never leave this plane, filled with
conflict and suffering as it seems to be, until you have lived the
experience of walking this Earth wholly as the <em>thought of Love in form</em>,
with no other allegiances but to Love. You will never leave this plane.
You will never take up your cross and follow me. You will spin around
again and again and again, only to be confronted by the same need to
decide <em>wholly for Love</em>.</p>

<p>And you‚Äôll finally look Heavenward and say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Father, let‚Äôs get on with it. Enough time has been wasted. Its gone, its
okay, it doesn‚Äôt matter. [claps hands] Now! I am committed to Love.
Bring on whatever I must experience to bring up from the depth ‚Äî the
places that I‚Äôve hid it within me ‚Äî every obstacle that must yet be
dissolved by the Light of the Grace of Perfect Love. And I will do
whatever I can, from my side of the fence, to open up those places, to
feel those places, to embrace those places, to love those places, to
claim those places as wholly self-created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I will let my parents off the hook, and I will let my siblings off
the hook, and I will let my great, great, great, great, great, great
grandfather off the hook. And I will let Adam and Eve off the hook, and
I will let the government off the hook. And I will love myself enough to
heal my separation from God.</p>

<p>And I will be humble enough to recognize that if I‚Äôm having an
experience, because I know I have made the commitment to healing, then
You have, indeed, precious Father, brought me all good things. For this
moment of experience can be seen through eyes that recognize that it is
but a stepping stone to the Perfect Peace that I seek.</p>

<p>My life is no longer mine, for I know not how to correct that one
fundamental error. But I can surrender into feeling each moment fully
while choosing Love anyway. And Love will dissolve the pain that I have
carried, all because I insisted on trying to separate myself from the
Source of my being.</p>

<p>This little gnat of mine is being put to rest. For the only thing that
can shine is Christ.</p>

<p>For Christ, the Son of God, the offspring of God, is God‚Äôs only
creation. The rest of it is attributed to you. Even space and time is
yours. <em>You</em>, the Truth of you, is your Creator‚Äôs only creation. For <em>you
are Love</em>, and God creates only that which is like unto Himself. And <em>God
is only Love</em>.</p>

<p>Many of you believe you are on a spiritual path. You will know if that
is true by your willingness to <em>feel</em> and <em>experience wholly exactly what
is in front of you</em>, moment to moment. Whoo! So if you have enmity with
another, if you have a conflict with another and you sit in your chair
and decide to do what you call pray or meditate, in order to change the
feeling state within yourself, and you arise later and say, ‚ÄúThere, I‚Äôm
feeling much better now,‚Äù but the issue has not been solved with
another, nothing has changed. Go, therefore, to the other. Open your
heart, share, resolve. If you have offended another, ask them their
forgiveness. If you have judged another, admit it. Ask for their
forgiveness. It is only in such a way that you can truly heal the place
of conflict within.</p>

<p>Beloved friends, the essence of this hour‚Äôs message is quite simple:</p>

<p>Where are you <em>now</em>? Are you willing to allow yourself to see everything
around you and within you as the doorway to the Kingdom of Heaven,
waiting only for you to acknowledge its presence and to open it? Are you
willing to truly be right where you are ‚Äî <em>wholly, right where you are</em>?
And the mind says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, of course. I‚Äôm on a spiritual path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rest assured, if you look well into your feelings and find any trace of
resistance, you have not yet made the necessary commitment that gives
you the <em>power</em> to open that door.</p>

<p><em>Feeling</em> is the message of this hour. For it is only through feeling that
you truly awaken. Concepts and ideas can begin to direct the mind to
believe that there is something out there that is attractive that might
even be better than what you‚Äôve been doing before. But concepts and
ideas do not, in themselves, open the door. They are symbols, and that
is all. And a symbol can not quench your thirst. It is only at the level
of genuine <em>feeling</em> that you can once again know the presence of God Who
dwells within you, around you, and through you, even now.</p>

<p><em>Feel</em> what you have created as a substitute for the Truth. Own it, look
upon it, then let it go. Learn that regardless of what choice you may
have made in the past, that once you have embraced it, once you have
felt it, you remain perfectly innocent and imbued with the power to
choose again ‚Ä¶ to <em>feel</em>, to learn once again to feel the glorious
warmth that permeates the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>Nothing you do with time can match the importance of what we have shared
in this hour. Nothing you do in the field of time holds a candle to the
incredible gift that is waiting for you. Therefore, indeed, <em>use time
constructively by deciding to love, that Love may teach you of Itself</em>.
And indeed, beloved and holy friends, when you have done this, you will
find yourself translated, if you will, into a form that could never
possibly be contained by the space and volume of a physical body.</p>

<p>And you will look upon this entire dimension as a mere temporary
learning device. And you will set it aside, as a child sets aside a toy
that has been outgrown. But you will do it with <em>deep appreciation</em> and
<em>love</em> for the toy that you‚Äôve played with for so long. And you will carry
with you a deep sense of gratitude for everything this physical
dimension has brought to you. There will be not a molecule, if you will,
of beingness within you that will feel any resentment, any longing, any
anger, any remorse for anything. And all of your experience will have
become wholly acceptable to you. For it was by such experience that you
were finally driven to want only the Truth. Hmm!</p>

<p>So! From this day forward you will never again be able to truly convince
yourself that all of your attempts to stay distracted or conformed to
the world are really accomplishing a thing. And you will find that your
mind begins to penetrate the unconscious habits you have created in an
attempt to hide from what must yet be felt. And you will know perfectly
well when you are simply deluding yourself. And you‚Äôll start to smile
and go,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, yes. Hmm, hmm, hmm. There I go again. Might as well set that aside.
Plant my feet firmly on the ground and, indeed, live with passion for
the Truth of the Kingdom of Heaven!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, for now, beloved friends, be you therefore at peace. We said
that this year, this <em>The Way of the Heart</em>, that we would, indeed, speak
ever more directly and even more forcefully to you. For the time comes
quickly when this planet will not be willing to tolerate untidy house
guests that are not willing to vibrate at the frequency of being to
which the planet herself is preparing to move toward. Hmm! Therefore, be
not caught by coming home one day and discovering that the landlord has
changed the locks and you have not a place to rest your head. Rather,
become the living embodiment of Love and journey with your Holy Mother
into an entirely new dimension of being. And never forget to sing,
laugh, dance and play along the way.</p>

<p>Be you, therefore, at peace, beloved and holy friends.</p>

<p>Peace, then, be with you.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
