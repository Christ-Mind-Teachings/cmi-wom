### Question

Is God self-aware, or is it simply a benign metaphysical force?

### Answer

Benign metaphysical force.

There is nothing more benign than Love. There is nothing more
metaphysical, which means beyond and permeating the physical, than God.
There is nothing more forceful, if you mean by that infinite power that
cannot be denied, than God. So if that is what you mean, I would say yes
to the use of those terms. Is God self-aware? Are *you* aware?

Hmm, hmm. Got it.
