### Question

Are we going to experience a period of three days of darkness
during this change upon the earth?

### Answer

We would suggest here that it is very probable that this will occur. And
yet, it will be a little longer than three days. This will eventuate, if
it is necessary for the change of vibration, to require what would be
called the changing of the axis of the planet. This will create a bit of
a shake-up, as one can imagine, and there will be created a
blackening-out, and the sunâ€™s rays will not touch the Earth. This sun
itself is going nowhere.

Yes, but listen well to what I say, for there are many prophecies coming
out, and there will be many more as we move closer and closer. Many are
getting pictures that are the effect of the generation in their own
minds of how they need to understand the ripples that are coming to
them. We speak of probabilities because it is never certain what must
eventuate for a change of vibration to occur. And you can liken this to
your own lives. Sometimes you need to be hit with a broom handle to get
your attention. At other times, a quiet whisper seems to be enough.

We would suggest that, because there is no separation, the more that
souls choose to awaken and to heal, the less the need for shocking
circumstances to get their attention. The more mankind awakens, the
easier the transition of the Earth. Does that make sense for you?
