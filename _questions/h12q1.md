### Way of the Heart, Lesson Twelve: Question One

On the day of your crucifixion, it was told that you spoke the words,
“Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?” Can you elaborate on that? Will
you?

---

### Answer

That is always the proper question. First, I have, indeed, given
forth this answer to a certain one that you’re aware of. We would highly
suggest that you merely obtain that answer, for it was not given to be
kept and held in privacy. Now, we would amend it by saying that I’ve
felt guilty about that statement ever since. [Laughter]

Beloved friend, if I have not touched every kernel of humanity and the
experience of it that you have known, it is useless for you to listen to
me. And I have nothing to offer you. Therefore, to have come into your
world and to have, shall we say, made myself impervious to doubt, pain,
guilt, tears, anger, you name it — yes, even lust — to have done that
would have rendered my relationship with you *meaningless*.

That is what we’ll give as an amendment, a clarification, a driving home
a very important point that can then be amended or added to the answer
that you will extract, that has already been given. Does that make sense
for you?

It is a very good question, but in the end, bring it around a little
further and ask of *yourself*,

> Why have I said, “Father, why have you forsaken me?”

Something to be pondered.
