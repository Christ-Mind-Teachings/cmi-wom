The Way of Mastery<br/><small><em>Pathway of Enlightenment</em></small>
</h2>

The Way of Mastery is a pathway offering a profound and comprehensive
theology and lived experience of love via a progression of teachings,
exercises and Living Practices, all devoted to a genuine – and radical -
depth of living enlightenment.

This depth goes beyond intellectual belief or the acceptance of certain
concepts and ideas. It guides the student into their essential and
eternal Heart, into a radical, transfigured gnosis, a ‘knowledge by
being that which is known.’

The purpose of The Way of Mastery is threefold:

* To create a pathway that can support any student from their first steps all the way to truly awakening into ‘Christ Mind’.
* To restore the original Teachings of Jeshua (Jesus) given to His followers.
* To ‘birth a million Christs.’

The Way of Mastery Pathway is comprised of:

* The Five Core texts and "The Early Years" channelings
* The Way of Mastery Living Practices and The Aramaic Teachings
* Facilitated Teachings by Pathway instructors
* Temple Canyon Sanctuary

## The Five Core texts and The Early Years

The Pathway began in 1987 when Jeshua suddenly appeared in a field of
brilliant light in the living room of Jayem (Jon Marc Hammer), who would
become the channel for The Way of Mastery. The remarkable series of
events that followed are recounted in the book The Jeshua Letters, the
first of five core texts.

The Way of the Servant, the second text, describing the ‘final stage of
enlightenment available in this world,’ soon followed.

During this period, 1988-1994, Jeshua channeled through Jayem for
growing numbers of students at public gatherings as well. The body of
these, recorded as audio teachings, are called The Early Years.

Examples of these include: *Love Heals All Things*, *Walk with Me*, *The
Feminine Christ*, *Death and Earth Changes*, and many others.

In 1994, Jeshua began the three-year series of teachings and exercises
known as *The Christ Mind Trilogy*. These three texts are the most well
know and widely distributed of all *The Way of Mastery Pathway* materials.

A set of remarkable, beloved teachings and exercises, they were
originally given monthly as audio recordings to a group of early
students over a three year period. They consist of:

* *The Way of the Heart*
* *The Way of Transformation  and*
* *The Way of Knowing*

Each of *The Christ Mind Trilogy* texts and set of exercises is meant to be
completed before moving on to the next.

## The Way of Mastery Living Practices

In *The Way of Transformation*, Jeshua shares that “initiatory
experiences” would eventually be “offered and provided.” These were
developed by Jeshua during the period in which *The Chirst Mind Trilogy*
came through, and for many years after, as He intensified the personal
discipleship of Jayem with a series of alchemical trainings.

These are *The Way of Mastery Living Practices*. They include:

* *LovesBreath*, a transformational breathing practice.

* *In the Name*, an attunement meditation, based on the prayer given to
Jayem and used to connect with Jeshua prior to every channeled teaching.

* *The Aramaic Teachings*. These reveal their hidden depth and restore the
richer meanings of some of Jeshua’s most essential and beautiful
teachings, long lost to poor translation. They include :

    * *The Aramaic Lord’s Prayer*: attunement (“Shalu” in Aramaic) of mind,
    breath, and body via the power and frequency of Jeshua’s native language
    of Aramaic.

    * *The Aramaic Beatitudes*: commonly known as ‘The Sermon on the Mount’,
    the "Blessed are the&hellip;" teachings of the Bible, the beatitudes, when
    seen in the translation from the original Aramaic, reveal with
    astonishing wisdom the nature and key stages of the soul’s journey. 

* Radical Inquiry, based on Jeshua's teaching in the first three
Aramaic Beatitudes, this is a  profound method of discovering, and
dissolving illusions held deep in the mind that construct the false
self, or Ego.

## Facilitated Teachings

Deepening into a spiritual path often requires support. To assist
students in the deepening of their journey into The Way of Mastery,
teachers have emerged from their own in-depth studentship.

Offerings include:

* Personal Sessions Offered with pathway teachers, these support the
healing and waking process, often greatly accelerate one’s journey. 

* Workshops, seminars and pilgrimages Travel to global sacred sites, and
a host of classes and gatherings led by pathway teachers.

## Temple Canyon Sanctuary

Temple Canyon is sacred land in Abiquiu, New Mexico, that Jeshua led
Jayem to miraculously purchase in the very earliest years of his
experience with Jeshua, and is meant for future development.

Sacred gatherings on the land have been, and continue to be, a regular occurrence as the pathway develops.

## In summary

The Way of Mastery is a Pathway of Enlightenment, which re-establishes
Jeshua’s original teachings, and in doing so offers a profound, in depth
pathway to support any awakening soul from the first inkling to awaken
all the way into knowing their most essential Self.

It aims at nothing less than a radical shift of Identity from ‘Ego’ to
‘Christ’: a return, and capacity aiding students to, increasingly, live
in and create from Christ Mind itself.

From this it seeks no less than the birthing of “a million Christs” on
this planet, and to transform life on this world, manifesting the
presence of Heaven on Earth, in so doing.
